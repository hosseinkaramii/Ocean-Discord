(sigh)  so don't think you won't help.   my ultimate goal is a data processing project  that will help prepare data for the ocean protocol (or whatever) for ai consumption. i have details and fun reasons. i have 25 years of on and off programming experience  but only shortly in swd - 99% in business or research (social network analysis) and large scale data engineering/devops problems. lots of experience with data collection.    i am looking to gather people around me who would like to talk about this project in more detail  but specifically  i want to gain the interest of an older student/teacher  who will be comfortable communicating consistently  and being my point of contact on this discord.   if anyone would like assistance from me  i would like to help  but i know zero at this point. i am willing to write a 'how to guide' as i do this.   this is elvis entering the building. sorry for the loud entry.,,,
