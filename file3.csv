I totally get where you're coming from! It's pretty surprising when a Web 3 company still sticks with a Web 2 one. I mean, Web 3 is all about decentralization and moving away from the big players like FAGAM. Instead, it's about embracing decentralized cloud infrastructure. So, using Google forms kind of contradicts the whole Web 3 vision, you know? And in Europe, people are really taking their digital sovereignty seriously. They're even taking legal action against FAGAM.
I've got a couple of suggestions for you to consider. How about using a form that stores information as an NFT linked to an Ocean DID? That way, it aligns more with decentralization and it's a great use case for Ocean. Plus, let's keep it simple! Maybe limit it to just three clicks from one wallet. That would make it super user-friendly and efficient.",,

An NFT form is quite an innovative idea indeed. As we carefully allocate our resources to best drive our organization's goals forward, developing an NFT form isn't quite high on our organizational priorities. That said, we do occasionally use Web 2 tools that drive our efficiency so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel in certain areas - hence using Discord for communications and Google for forms. Creative feedback is always welcome 🙂 Feel free to keep the ideas coming!",,

Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💡︱idea-factory [1088534285478269038],1100672899431546920,poseidon2525,05/25/2023 3:31 AM,"Absolutely, time is a precious asset, and managing it wisely is crucial. The transition from Web 2 to Web 3 is inevitable, and it brings exciting possibilities. I envision – for the moment - Ocean Protocol as a storage middleware between DApps and data assets, handling authentication and authorization. In a way, it can be seen as a Web 3 database where NFTs are stored as records.
What's intriguing about Web 3 architecture is that it can be seen as a massive decentralized computer. It enables extensive computation in a decentralized manner, which is a stark contrast to traditional data centers. These centralized compute nodes (aka data center), aside from being unsustainable and straining national power grids, pose security concerns due to centralization.
Consider climate research, where datasets spanning 10 years and captured from smart IoT devices are used. Web 3 architecture, with its incentive mechanisms for citizens and companies to share computing and storage resources, could provide an economically viable solution. Adding Ocean Protocol's smart control ensures efficient data management, outsourcing tasks like lifecycle management and data copy management, thus limiting the impact of outages with the option to create a digital commons. (eg climate data as a digital common asset )
The potential of Web 3 extends beyond climate research, empowering users with control over their data and digital assets. By embracing blockchain technology, decentralized applications, and protocols, we can create a more secure, private, and user-centric internet. The transition to Web 3 is an exciting step towards a decentralized future! 💻🌐🚀",,"💯 (3),❤️ (2)"

We don't recommend to fractionalise NFTs and profit from work others do to profit yourself as this does not pass the Howey test in our opinion - we are using a different method to reach the same goal. Please check with a lawyer first what rules apply in your jurisdiction.",,"👍 (2),🥰 (1)"

I'm examining IPTs: rights to an asset held on-chain by many wallets in the form of an IP commons/pool where an asset has its own governance framework, or itself a mini-DAO. Thoughts on this?",,

So if you go back in history to the famous orange farm where the Howey test was invented - a farmer sells rights to the future oranges that will be grown on a piece of land, thus creating a security as:
1. Financial investment - you spend money to acquire your share ✅
2. Shared enterprise - an NFT/IP NFT gets fractionalised and everyone gets a share ✅
3. Expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others - you are not going to do the research in the case of an IPT, in the case of fractionalising a DataNFT you are also a passive holder of your fraction while others contribute or sell the data. ✅

It could of course be argued in 3. that you somehow are doing something but I am not a lawyer, for me its clear that your share of the work is not going to bring most of the money, that is why you work with others.

Thus you create a security.

In the end a protocol like Molecule or other NFT fractionalising protocols don't have to care too much about this, as the users of the tech are the ones breaking the law, not the protocols themselves.
But the users of the tech like VitaDAO or someone then creating a fractionalised NFT will be legally responsible.

I am not a lawyer, I just follow the crypto space for 6 years now and it is a common theme that people create tech that will put their users in jail in their jurisdiction when they use it, IF the government would care enough. So I always recommend caution or to move somewhere where these things don't matter too much.",,"👍 (1),🙏 (1)"

@Zomboy thanks for reaching out! we currently don't have a team member in Benelux but remote developer support is available. as Nima mentioned. Would be happy to hear more about the scope of your project to determine how we can be of help

Unfortunately not, NiMA reached out and mentioned it as well - the only challenge posted seems to be quite crowded, and the hackathon is the weekend before exam week for us, since we're still students 🙁  However we will be sure to stay in touch and keep up to date with all the fun events coming up. 

We're hoping to address the reproducibility crisis in ML/AI research by integrating decentralized tokenized data assets for researchers to build better datasets, while using decentralized computing networks to deploy models such that communities of researchers can see step-by-step how research was conducted, and can fork projects to reproduce results without having to interpret papers or recreate complex models from scratch.",,👌 (2)

Working on a white-paper of a multi-sided marketplace. 

I have been struggling between the 2 revenue models below for the platform:

1) Use a platform native token - I call it CTD- to settle all transactions in the platform. For instance, if investors wants to pay the tokenization fees of their assets to Appriasers they will need to use CTD. Investors if they wish to invest in a particular asset need to buy CTD and invest in the tokens of that asset, and obviously all assets on the platform will be denominated in CTD.  So no service fee charged for any service that the platform provides such as listing the asset tokens or their trading  -> instead gradual issuance and sales of CTD (increase in demand) and its value appreciation will fund the CAPEX and OPEX to run the platform [CTD will be listed on popular exchanges so they can be traded against other currencies]

Pro: lowers the barrier for entry + incentivize participation in network activities and maximum alignment for risks and rewards 

Con: Building a platform + a new currency (that can add liquidity challenge on top of platform building risks & since the CTD token value is not stable due to the price discovery through the supply and demand can make the volatile asset tokens more risky -dual volatility or the asset tokens + CTD) 

2) Do not use CTD as a settlement currency on the platform. Use DAI or a another stable-coin to settle all transactions in #1 -> instead charge service fees in DAI on all transactions to generate revenue -> issue CTD to the community (its now a revenue generating token) to fund CAPEX and OPEX

Pro: more liquidity as DAI and other stable-coins can be more popular and result it better network effect + laser focus on the platform development and the product market fit vs. doing both the currency and platform management at the same time

Con: Less incentive to invest in CTD (maybe?) as asset tokens are independent from transactions since u DAI is used for settlement",,🚀 (1)

(1) Though having a stable coin makes life easier in initial stages but you are essentially dependent on another coin which you have no say in. Your marketplace can suffer significantly is Maker community increase lending rates (meaning less DAI is available in the market and eventually your marketplace)
(2)  DAI is a stable coin, it wont appreciate inherently. its value is pegged to USD and it will always be that. So that limits the value capture that an internal token can have. (e.g) KNC, BNB etc. 
(3) Ocean Protocol provides all the benefits of first approach (internal currency with potential to appreciate significantly) + marketplace framework + dedicated tech and community support, like I am doing right now ;). All you need to do is just customise marketplace as per your needs and launch. Btw Ocean Protocol also have programs to help with funding if we see potential in your marketplace.",,

@doink to download the data when purchased. Data providers doesn't need to worry about it. You can just go and store in whichever format you want. When someone buys it, Ocean will stream your data (if not private and you selected 'access' service ) back to buyer. Transition happens in blob format and client later encodes it to proper format",,

Ocean is a protocol and network on which data marketplaces can be built to unlock data for sharing and selling. It enables data to be shared. Most other projects are decentralized / centralized marketplaces or data brokers.

@doink 
1) Marketplace defers most hard lifting - payment, escrow, access control to Ocean Protocol. Only major initiative marketplace has to own is dispute resolution. Way they handle it conveys their trust provision.

2) Not in white label setup. But since most of the critical tasks are performed at the protocol level in a decentralised way, it is not critical to decentralise them. This was done to improve adoption amongst incumbent marketplaces and provider services.  But, if you choose to decentralise your provider component it is not too difficult.

3) Not only. Keepers are the core part of Ocean Protocol. They are the main component. Rest other components can be customised and modified as per your needs (this answers your Q5), all its needed that they communicate and interact with keeper contracts with defined interface. Apart from auditing and accounting, keepers handle access control, escrow, payments etc.

4) No. metadata is a part of overall DDO structure that every component understands. So, if you were to change it to another structure (what would you change it to?) you will have to define and implement that interface for other components as well (aquarius, brizo, squid etc.)

5) Answered in 3.

6) This will help you understand it better - https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/secret-store/",,

1. transaction for creating the asset happens on-chain
2. storing the metadata happens in the metadata store, called Aquarius, essentially just a plain-old web 2.0 database (for now)

Deleting the asset via Aquarius API/squid-js removes it from the database so it will be not returned by marketplaces querying for assets on that Aquarius instance.

correct.

@peanutbutterandicecream via compute to data Ocean allows  data providers to bring compute to data without moving the data. This already resolves lots of compliance issues. But, Ocean is a generic protocol for generic data domain. Meaning it is data agnostic. Now if marketplaces and data providers deal with sensitive data and if they are based in a restricted zone then its upto marketplace to handle these regulatory compliances at higher levels (thats why you see 'Accept Cookies' etc options on web apps). It is extremely difficult if not impossible to bake custom regulatory compliances into the tech at L1 layer because either they are too many or they change frequently as law changes.",,

@endro Hey Tom, Ocean has its own chain/network, it can be connected to any network. I'm not Web3 tech savvy and can't advise on how to bridge across networks in a decentralized fashion (i.e. co-existence), and I'm not aware if such bridge with Polkadot already exists, but fundamentally it can be done. If you have interest in building that bridge I'd say @Manan is the right go to person to talk to. This looks like a promising area of exploration to me",,👍 (1)

@Deleted User unless you are a stable coin, there is no incentive in pegging the token valuation to lower end.  Higher valuation funds Ocean Protocol's roadmap to few more years, helps general awareness around protocol, attracts more investors and builders to build on protocol, attracts more partners due to increased awareness, and all this drives adoption. So, yes better valuations are better for the whole ecosystem.",,👍 (1)

I emailed ocean protocol's team and I have yet to receive a response back. I need a way to get my WETH ($10k) and OCEAN ($10k) that are tied up in the pool that I can no longer remove. If anyone can help me at Ocean by responding to my email or just by giving me access to my money that would be greatly appreciated.

But it seems you do not have fully understood what a decentralized exchange and a Uniswap pool is, and that smart contracts can't be tricked. When adding liquidity to a pool you are GIVING AWAY your tokens. A liquidity pool is not meant for storing tokens like a wallet, because you do not control the pool and you cannot expect profit from it without acknowledging the higher risks to get them. A liquidity pool introduces a lot of risks compared to simply holding your tokens in a wallet you control, making it your responsibility to know when to move out your tokens. Which is why we communicated that fact extensively in the last months. In crypto, even more so in liquidity pool yield farming, there is no set-and-forget-about-it.

Technology-wise, the old contract has been paused, on the smart contract level. Meaning there simply is no way to move your tokens, or any other tokens under that contract anymore. There is no trick, no fallback, no hack we can activate, which is the whole point in a decentralized setup.

If you want fully matured and insured technology I suggest you look into established and centralized financial instruments, like stocks.",,

When did you actually update the page with the new token address? Incidentally, on uniswap the new token has not got an icon yet...it is still with the old one. Couldn't you have worked this out before?

I'm going on a bit, I know, but it doesn't seem like it was properly done as you would know already if there was liquidity etc and maybe should have not paused the old contract if some users had large amounts in there that weren't recoverable....then later you say they were and 'we always have a plan'.

> Even the link you gave did not have the new address while the token swap was happening!!!
yes of course. The new address could only be exposed once all swaps completed and everybody had their new tokens. Otherwise people early in the swap batch would have had an advantage over those not having received them yet. And it all took around 5 hours to complete. Right after the completion we updated all our messaging and started contacting exchanges and such with the new token contract. 

> btw why does there still seem to be 30ETH of liquidity in the old pool and why does uniswap still let you add liquidity??
Uniswap does not let you add liqudity to the pool with the old token since the moment we paused the old contract, which happened right before we started the swap. Every interaction with that pool failed from the moment on we paused the contract. Technically yes, all old contract tokens locked in a liquidity pool are lost. But of course we have a plan in place when liquidity providers can proof to us their tokens are locked. 

> When did you actually update the page with the new token address? 
At the exact time the swap completed and 99.999999% of accounts had their tokens. Same time as releasing the blog post, although we had a small deployment hickup resulting in a 4 min. delay between site & blog.

> Incidentally, on uniswap the new token has not got an icon yet...it is still with the old one. Couldn't you have worked this out before?
No, because the new contract address was needed first, which was only created when the swap started. The rest is up to other projects and their development/deployment processes. Example: I submitted the required change for the icon to show up on Uniswap right after the swap 2 days ago: https://github.com/Uniswap/default-token-list/pull/336",,

HOTBIT Support 
Hello,

The smart contract address is different from the deposit address, your deposit address is correct, but the contract address is wrong. In other words, you deposited a token that is not listed on Hotbit

Thanks

Hi,
During your deposit process, please do carefully verify and confirm your deposit address and the type of token you intend to deposit (due to the fact that there are many types of ERC 20 tokens, it is possible that different types of ERC 20 tokens may share the same abbreviation while their full titles may be different from each other) if you deposit your tokens into the wrong address, it is very likely that your tokens will not be retrieved.
Hotbit is not responsible for helping our users to retrieve all mistakenly deposited tokens. However, in order to help our users to retrieve all serious loss caused by their misoperation, we will still try our best to retrieve all tokens that are mistakenly deposited by our users. Please read all following information carefully and wait patiently:
1. bla bla bla 
2. bla bla bla

It might take three to six months to retrieve your assets. Please do be patient.
3. Due to the strict risk control verification process, you need to pay 0.3 ETH by original sending address that you transferred this transaction mistakenly to switch back the coins. The transerred address is 0x5c0e7D5D2c3f244083eA00a8c6b17c42120ac632 and then send TXID to us so that we can check it for you. Attention please: Due to the strict risk control verification process, we can only send your assets back to your original sending address later.

With best regards,

Ronald

@Deleted User Ocean provides tools to help with regulations like GDPR. How marketplaces use these tools is upto them. Meaning correct implementation with proper process can ensure compliance but Ocean do not dictate how they should implement those processes. Each geography has different compliance requirements and so Ocean is process-agnostic. Every marketplace in any geography can use Ocean and apply process that makes them complaint to their particular region.",,

@Robin | DataUnion 

Well if you just look at uniqueness then go for it. I could add one dot to your logo and be unique, too:-)

I would rather look into the Appearance of similarities.  If I am telling you that they look irritating, then there is no discussion that thousands others are also thinking the same.

Distinguishing in marketing does not mean uniqueness. It means different to a degree where it would not even appear similar. To much is similar. Black background. White dots. Size of dots. Number of dots. Density of dots. Only the directions are different.

You could become a big project, you want to be recognized in all search engines and platforms by your logo...

Not sure what exactly you mean by that but Ocean Protocol does not store data so storing data in a secure way is the responsibility of a publisher. The marketplace and Ocean Protocol only store an encrypted reference to that data file.

@doink Actors of a data marketplace are data consumer, data providers and compute providers ( algo/workflows suppliers ).  In a logistic marketplace you can have different companies that leveraging the incentives to provide access data.

@Ashish dexFreight is simplifying logistics with a decentralized platform for freight brokers, shippers and carriers to handle shipments from booking to payment in one place. dexFreight is building a universal decentralized, open-source network that enables collaboration and facilitates the coordination of movement of goods while bringing liquidity to the supply chain.

In the process dexFreight is generating a lot of data about supply chain in logistics industry. They want to monetise and learn from this data.

Makes totally sense that OCEAN is used as ecosystem token for data exchanges.  There would be chaos otherwise with hundreds of different ways. Needs to be consistent one standard token. And it should be the token of the protocol which makes sense.",,💯 (1)

Hi, Ethereum is getting really burednsome. high congestions, high fees, slow transactions. It will get worse because everyone is loading everything onto Eth.

I am worried about Ocean as you are running on Eth. It would be a thing if you were just some small defi project or a simple dapp .But you are collaborating with some of the world's leading corporations and your use cases regarding Big Data require highest scalability by-design.

there are layer 2 or 3 solutions but the more dependencies the more error potentials.

Is there any brainstorming going on with your foundation to add a more scalable protocol layer?


Ben from SingularityNet also mentioned in a podcast that for Future use cases, Eth will clearly not be sufficient in terms of required scalability and complexity. And the are researching for new protocol layers. And AGI has similar use cases like Ocean.

If yes, I would suggest you take a look at the Californian Protocol called **Lamden**:

General: twitter.com/LamdenTau


You are the experts, I am sure you can chat with them and decide if it makes sense for you to use their protocol. But just to list you some of their features:

- fully build from scratch in Python, supporting all Python libraries (testing, ML)- Python has the largest dev community in the world of business for big data,ML&AI - the key use cases for Ocean. 

- They have sub-second (400ms) block time and txs finality 
-Scales easily per CPU CORE (4k tps/core): 32k tps with 8 cores, etc. 
- interoperable on layer 1, full bridges to Eth & other chains. Atomic Triggers &transactions. Could be interesting as you are agnostic 

- write contracts in any language
- They say entire multiplayer games run on their blockchain, all on layer 1, as proof of scalability

I am not an expert but thought to make you aware and you get in touch with their team to understand more 

Much success to you",,

@Manan  appreciate you.

And advise from an outsider: there should be some hard facts to screen the available protocols. For example if a protocol states on their website that they are capable of 100 tps. Then clearly it should not be in your short list. But as soon as you have screened some very scalable ones (and all other criteria you look for);

 just go and USE their protocols. Not only brainstorm theoretically, just test it plug into their layer and start doing what you do. Best way of finding out which one fits your needs the best. You can chat and read all you want, at the end you should plug into it and test for yourself. Quick and easy, one protocol per week 😄 And hope Lamden will deserve a test round, too since they scale linearly per CPU Core (4k tps per core, 32k tps with 8 cores, etc. you get the picture...)  good luck!",,

you had such a great idea to provide a easy to use UI/UX for storing data/files securely by IPFS.  Even published a first MVP. Like a dropbox alternative for everyone to use. What happened to this idea, still going on? Could you link that storage to your OCEAN token, in this sense for example: It is required to Stake some amount of Oceans and while you are staking you are free to use the storage. A link with the token (=UTILITY token) would be good imo.  

 There is not one user friendly and secure alternative until now for everyday users who want to depart from Dropbox but are still waiting. Filecoin is not even launched after 4 years. Not much providers in this space. It would be great addition to your data centric vision.

When can we expect a full workable file storage with a nice UI/UX?",,

@Manan Don't forget Lamden to test it, too please, be open minded, *at least test their tech to know for sure how it performs*.. 

> this decision will be shaping your platform for many years to come, **test thoroughly**:D 

Python community stands behind Lamden, number 1 language for big data/AI/ML used in all corporations. they worked 3 years in complete stealth mode on their protocol and mainnet went live recently. 

Very few provide such Layer 1 scalability (without any dependencies): sub-second tx finality (400ms), tps scale by number of cpu cores, very straightforward. 4,000 tps per core. 16 cores = 64,000tps. Fully interoperable with multiple chains by design. 


Most importantly security and easiness: Full support of all python libraries, testing suites. Security is all about continous testing and clear code writing.

And it is amendable (think Tezos), governance by design the protocol can be proposed and voted on. This way you stay always ahead of the game and always adapt to the state of the art technology at any given time. Future proof. 

Best of luck:)

@anu Yes I think several have used it.

And in my view it **is ok** that they use it. Because it is there. Why not?  Right now it helps everyone.

@Deleted User Its acceptable to me because people keep their tokens on CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES. Its acceptable because we DONT need another $21M of stolen Ocean tokens being sold back to exchanges. A lot of the decentralized chains have this or similar functionality to protect holders, and i wish ALL of them did after watching this happen, to protect us from lousy and sloppy smart contracts and security holes left open by centralized exchanges. Thank you, Ocean team! Awesome Job!!! If everyone stopped using CEX's or at least stopped storing your assets there, this wouldnt have been an issue in the first place. So, stop complaining about them protecting your cash in what you call a ""centralized"" fashion, when you MOST LIKELY use a CENTRALIZED exchange and hold MOST your assets there to begin with! Blame the exchange - not Ocean",,

@Matthias 

""no single team member can execute that method"" ""board members.""

Are you not watching mainstream media and all the corruption cases in BIG corporations with much BIGGER BOARDS than Ocean COLLUDING and maliciously acting on regular basis?  

And you give ""board members"" as re-assurance for a 50 employee company? Come one you can do better, not repeat the failed systems of current centralized governance models.

 Having said that, I very much like your proposed solution and also wanted to suggest something like that. A decentralized DAO GOVERNANCE layer:-)

Thank you and looking forward to observing how you shift control in the future. please do work on that diligently, when you look at the market you will realize nothing is worth it without real secure Governance by the community (or relevant stakeholders)..",,

Who  would like to give the keys to precious data and assets to some unknown developers or board members of one single organization?  
@Matthias 
You will have so many corporate users.  Do you think they would feel comfortable by knowing your board has the keys to interrupt or stop their business operations? By shifting control to decentralized DAO structure, you actually expand your business  opportunities and will be attractive for many many more users. 

Please shift to community-led /DAO governance where non-ocean related stakeholders participate in voting.",,

> I am not entirely clear. Is a datatoken the OCEAN token, or is it a different token that is made for a custom data marketplace? Or something else entirely?
@Sarah (Sweet Chilli) A datatoken is an ERC20 token corresponding to a dataset. It has several purposes:
- it can be used to access the data
- it can be used to trade via a liquidity pool to buy or sell it
- it can be used to provide liquidity/stake to a liquidity pool
- more uses could be added in the future
When V3 will be released the liquidity pools will be on Balancer and the pools will be composed of OCEAN tokens and datatokens.",,👍 (2)

@Mattt When the data is bought a fee is subtracted that is rewarded to the liquidity providers, the marketplace and the Ocean community. This is normally 0.3% like in Uniswap. But can be adjusted when the pool is created.
This is like yield farming on Uniswap or some other DeFi platform. Except that the farming is not happening when tokens are swapped but when data is being bought.",,

So yes, you're getting the swap fees but as the liquidity leaves the pool the number of OCEAN tokens (total including data token conversion) goes down relative to that decrease in liquidity. So you should really be mindful of the pools you're staking in from the standpoint of ""Do I think this data is valuable and wanted by the market"" ""How long do I think this data will be valuable for?"" or else you could be left in a pool where liquidity has exited and the once gain in OCEAN you had is gone.",,

I took the ocean training course and I saw it mention different access types that don't actually appear for me in the publisher tool. Also the training course states ""Data access will follow the ERC20 token standard.

@Crypto Rootz I hate that page 🙂 The lists are fetched directly from chain and this gets more expensive the more  transactions there are, which is why we banned those expensive calls onto its own page in the first place.

@Matthias  
It’s a little misleading though to call this staking since no staking is involved. You are not growing your coins when you pool your tokens into a data set because of  Proof of Stake, you’re growing them at the expense of people who come late to the pool. In short, it’s a ponzi or pyramid scheme. You should call it as such instead.",,

@GME Moon Mission I wouldn't call it misleading. Look at the facts - Ocean Protocol is not a layer-1 proof of stake protocol liek EOS or likewise and we dont claim that at all. Staking is a common lingo in Defi space (e.g.) 0x, synthetix and other's use the same phrasing. Even Aave calls the migration portal from LEND to AAVE tokens as ""Staking"".  If we talk about Ocean, our original intention was and still is - LPs will stake (provide liquidity) on the valuable datasets thereby helping the market curate most interesting datasets. Now, people use crypto platforms the way they want and not always the way they were designed to. And that itself is leaning towards product-market fit (and thats whats happening in Ocean Market right now). So, to make the point whatever we call it staking or not, people will use it the way they want to use it. And calling it a ponzi scheme is bit exaggeration because what you see today in Ocean Market is how world's financial markets (stocks, bonds, forex etc.) works. There is always risks involved. And we try to make it very clear when someone tries stake on a dataset. And most of them are aware of the risks they are taking.",,💯 (2)

@Deleted User usually compute providers will share sample data. And you would adjust your algo to train on that format and params.

Look at the facts - Ocean Protocol is not a layer-1 proof of stake protocol liek EOS or likewise and we dont claim that at all. Staking is a common lingo in Defi space (e.g.) 0x, synthetix and other's use the same phrasing. Even Aave calls the migration portal from LEND to AAVE tokens as ""Staking"".  If we talk about Ocean, our original intention was and still is - LPs will stake (provide liquidity) on the valuable datasets thereby helping the market curate most interesting datasets. Now, people use crypto platforms the way they want and not always the way they were designed to. And that itself is leaning towards product-market fit (and thats whats happening in Ocean Market right now). So, to make the point whatever we call it staking or not, people will use it the way they want to use it. And calling it a ponzi scheme is bit exaggeration because what you see today in Ocean Market is how world's financial markets (stocks, bonds, forex etc.) works. There is always risks involved. And we try to make it very clear when someone tries stake on a dataset. And most of them are aware of the risks they are taking.
@Manan Pray do tell for what reason bacteria data should be priced at $500 when this can be had for free at universities and the internet? No matter how much you try to wrap up pyramiding and ponzi schemes in fancy terms, it's still pyramiding and ponzi schemes.",,

@tarunk99 only the wallet address that paid datatoken gets the access. This access is not transferable. Current implementation of Ocean Provider gives permanent access once bought but your custom provider can give limited time access as well. And when you transfer datatoken you get the access. 

Its like -if I bought Netflix coupon for  1 month subscription from any supermarket, but that subscription will not be activated before I redeem that coupon. So, once I activate subscription my coupon becomes invalid. 
Here, 
subscription = dataset
coupon = datatoken
Netflix = provider",,

2) When you publish data, you would already provide a sample data that defines data structure, features, parameters etc. So, the consumers (data scientists) can prepare their algorithms according to the fields defined. 
3) Using algorithms and datasets as fundamental units, one can then create a compute pipeline where first step would be to run cleaning algo on the data, then results of that could be passed to another algo for data processing etc.

I've not yet quite understood the concept of buying and consuming data. 
Does it mean, at first I buy 1 token and I'll be granted exactly 1 download? 

Is it possible to sell a dynamic database, where each call needs a datatoken? 

Furthermore, the high transaction fees on Ethereum still discourage me to use the system. Are you working on something else? Sidechains, etc.? 
I'd need a data call every 5min. Paying ~2€ every time would make me a very poor man.

I'm part of the Ambassador program and have been told I'll be officially given a title shortly. You'll get access to a private channel in the server and become part of the Ocean community.

The project itself is open source, and was created in a way so that it would be easily extendable for developers. 
We have added a module system so that new integrations and functionalities can be added. For example, we have created a Slate (a Filecoin frontend) module whose functionality can be enabled and disabled.
The extension is still being reviewed by google, but you can still unpack the builds from GitHub and test it as is. It's still in an alpha stage, but the provided builds are quite usable.
Any feedback or requests for functionality is welcome! :)

The first who adds liquidity is setting the price of the set? Any addition info would be very helpful. Thank you in advance.",,

In case of the fixed price you set the price.
In case of the liquidity pool you provide an initial liquidity which will set the initial price but other parties can then add liquidity to change it. Over time this provides a price signal of the dataset.
It is not random but noisy - which means that the price can vary drastically over time but at some point it will become more stable.
Your initial liquidity is not affected by the additions and removal of other liquidity - it is safe. But you can set a swap fee and benefit from sales, swaps, liquidity provisioning etc.

If you want to try it out to get some practical experience you can try e.g. the Ropsten Ethereum testnetwork.",,👍 (1)

The APY for the datasets on the marketplace is unknown at the moment and there is not too much traffic so it is more speculation than farming. Farming rewards will be enabled later.
Bancor has impermanent loss protection which kicks in after 100 days so this is a long time option.
Loads of options to be honest with many facets. You have to read and make up your mind 🙂 There is no website yet which recommends you the staking model that matches to your risk reward and amount of money - at least that I know of.",,

It costs Gas to create your own dataset.
You can try it out on Rinkeby without any real assets - that is an Ethereum testnet and you can get free Ocean tokens and Ethereum on it. Google for Ethereum faucet and Ocean faucet. They give you free tokens on the testnet Rinkeby.
Check out this video by the team on how to use the marketplace to publish data:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiDg0ry6oV4

Regarding your criticism about the usability - so far 278 datasets have been published. It must be reasonably easy or that would not have happened.

The protocol is based on Ethereum and it is necessary to pay Gas to interact with it. Ethereum is at its all time high right now so Gas prices are very high. Ocean Protocol will support level 2 solutions and also offer marketplaces on other blockchains e.g. Polkadot in the future. There these interactions will be cheaper.",,

1.) The current market lacks scalability for large expensive dataset. With 70/30 the amount of ocean required for the initial liquidity is simply too much. Splitting up the datasets into many smaller doesn't solve the problem as X + gas < n * ( X / n + gas) .  I made a proposal on github for ""spliced datasets"" that could be a solution to the problem.
https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379
2.) Datasets published before the pump have now increased in value but also the price per Token is now 3x higher than before. That will prevent sales. The problem will (hopefully) increase over time.
3.) Whats currently missing in the market is the buy/consume side. To attract real consumers to the market I would consider vouchers for potential consumers to spend on datasets for a limited time. e.g. 2000 Ocean to spend on data within 24h. 
4.) Hard locking initial liquidity for limited period would dramatically reduce rug pull incentive. This could be combined with lower pool ratios: e.g. 3 month hard lock => 50/50, 9 Month 30/70, 12 month 10/90",,

The service should offer compute on our image datasets. I imagine to train Tensorflow networks for both classification and detection via CTD. I looked into the documentation. The compute to data guide gives a high level overview. Thats good. But the gap from the guide to the follow-up links (e.g. OEP-12) is too high for me. The questions that pop up:
1.) Which type of AWS environment I need? 
2.) Is AWS the only option so far?
.....
The links of both the tutorial and walkthrough are broken. But this seems to be true for more links down the repo. Maybe run a linkchecker there.
To close the gap I would suggest a step by step hands-on tutorial that deploys an example CTD on AWS. That could be e.g some tutorial with instructions what to modify, where and how to register, including a docker script that documents the basic components and their setup required to run a custom CTD node.. @Manan",,

You can do all of that but you have to use the Python or JavaScript library to do so. There you can choose any split.
The change towards this in the UI was made as other splits were enabling rug pulls as they required very little initial Ocean staked by the creator and increased the value of the datatokens dramatically. This enabled the creators to rug pull stakers easily.
Regarding 2.)
In my (accepted) proposal for this round of OceanDAO grants (https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/proposal-liquidity-pool-handling-2-0/370/3) I am working on a dApp that will enable you to diversify your liquidity pool by adding more tokens.

You might be happy to hear that the roadmap does indeed address the issues you raise. I'll go through them one-by-one here.

> (1) The current market lacks scalability for large expensive dataset. [Created issue https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379] 

There seem to be two separate concerns. (1) Unclear how to handle super-large dataset with many files (2) Concern of high initial liquidity needs for valuable dataset. I responded thoroughly in the github issue created. https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379#issuecomment-780686815. Let's do further iterations there.

> (2) Datasets published before the pump have now increased in value but also the price per Token is now 3x higher than before. That will prevent sales. The problem will (hopefully) increase over time.

Note that is something that people can arb for, based on what they think the value is denominated in. Just like in any other AMMS in Uniswap, Balancer, etc. 

However we can soften this to reduce the effects of impermanent loss, by ""OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Market"". That's targeted for Q2.

Finally, ""Better Staking"" (Q4) will decouple amount of stake from price. 

> (3) Whats currently missing in the market is the buy/consume side. To attract real consumers to the market I would consider vouchers for potential consumers to spend on datasets for a limited time. e.g. 2000 Ocean to spend on data within 24h.

Agreed in this goal. ""Data Farming"" (Q2) will bring an extra layer of incentives for people to supply / consume data.",,

Hard locking initial liquidity for limited period would dramatically reduce rug pull incentive. This could be combined with lower pool ratios: e.g. 3 month hard lock => 50/50, 9 Month 30/70, 12 month 10/90

Agreed, this helps. ""Better Staking"" (Q4) includes vesting periods on datatokens.

I'd love to say we can do ""Better Staking"" sooner, but it has prerequisites to build it in a clean, maintainable fashion. We are building those prerequisites in earlier quarters.",,❤️ (1)

(a) Compute-to-data where the ""compute"" is selection of the subset of data. How to price: if you have S / M / L selection sizes, then have one AMM for each selection size. You could use this approach in your DataUnion app. Or Ocean Market might support it when it fully supports Compute-to-Data, though this looks like an extra feature on top so it could be a while.

(b) Have a different datatoken for each of the 1000+ files; then make a ""basket"" token to bundle them together, using eg Set Protocol, Balancer (v2 for >8 tokens), or ERC998. One question is how to price. One way is to have an AMM for each base item; arbitrage bots will keep prices fairly balanced. Another way is to have fixed price on each base item. A second question is what's the best way to bundle; different things would need to be tried. A third Q is how to have those bundles in Ocean Market or otherwise; Ocean Market will evolve that way starting with "">1 pool per datatoken"", but this could extend.",,

But different algorithms will have different runtimes on GPUs - so they will also cost different amounts of money for the hardware platform.
If we do baskets here e.g. 1 GPU hours and 1000 images would be basket A, then 10 GPU hours and 10.000 images would be basket B etc.

Then this would not really be a good experience for the buyers - at least how I would feel as a buyer.
My thoughts from a customer point of view: 
* Cloud platforms like AWS or Azure allow renting and payment of resources in seconds and they expect us to use something similar. So why does it have to be so non granular in pricing?
* I want to train on 2843 images but why do I pay the same as to train on 9999 images?

I want to benchmark the white listed algorithms and then offer precise costs for them so people only pay for what they consume.
For the data that will be consumed in addition to that I can track the cost for it as we produce that ourself.

And I think this is a way to do that which other companies/projects also want to follow.

""arbitrary"" is a synonym for ""unlimited complexity""
Human capability to deal with complexity is very limited and human and artificial intelligence is fundamentally different.  What is going to happen if the number of labels is growing in an uncontrolled fashion is that there is no consistency between labels and image content. That will have a significant negative impact on AI and therefore on the value of the dataset. Inconsistent and low quality datasets are still the norm today.
In order to create and *maintain* a dataset of high value it is imo mandatory to have a fabric that links labels to image content from an AI and *not* a human perspective. To prevent introducing human perception bias into the data I highly recommend to have this in place before starting.",,

Just the labels are an issue: There are 13 synonyms for ""women"". Now multiply that with all languages and arbitrary list of labels. 
But the main differentiator is that human perception is context and expectation driven and hence very subjective. AI perception is mostly independent from context and hence objective.  In the example below example you see a classic example of ""human bias"". Based on context a human claims a grey blob on a pedestrian bridge to be a human. For AI it is grey blob like thousand other grey blobs in a multidimensional vector. If you now label this grey blob ""Human"" AI will try to separate this grey blob from all the other grey blobs which is in fact impossible without full understanding of the image context. Labels like this have a negative impact on  AI performance as this labels are trained in hundredthousands of iterations . https://www.evotegra.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/humans.jpg",,

I was unaware of this phenomenon before today. I think you're right that labeling using AI and human supervision would avoid this issue.

I also agree that if you don't specify the set of allowed labels at the start, then you will get inconsistent labels or label composition or perhaps even maliciously incorrect or useless labels.

In Robin's idea where the data consumers can make queries like [red, car, female driver, day light] I wonder if he means that the resulting data set then has all non-matching labels stripped out? Like if the picture that contains [red, car, female driver, day light] also contained a [dog], would the [dog] label be removed because the data consumers doesn't care about the presence of dogs?",,👍 (1)

As my background in the annotation business comes from years in the automotive industry the focus for us is to create a baseline of images that enable us to train specific algorithms and then use these algorithms to prelabel images. It is not necessary to create one algorithm that can detect all classes but rather multiple algorithms that detect a subset of classes. Humans then act as a quality controller and verifier of the algorithms predictions.

This enables us to create arbitrary classes without exposing the individual contributors to a level of complexity where they cannot deliver good results anymore. So after the initial annotation phase we can switch into that mode.

I think one key missing thing is a specification for composibility in which a compiled dataset is composed of subdatasets.

You could mint individual tokens for each person and compose into a larger dataset which streams revenue to the individuals or you could define a new specification with embedded DIDs..

Ok, we have the same issue with DataUnion.app - so here is my take on this:
We are doing that management for the users at the moment. So we are building a database where we store which user contributed to which data and if the dataset is sold we distribute this to the users accounts in the database and if they reach a threshold they can withdraw that amount from our website (Gas costs are tough).

Optimally you would do this with a smart contract and having that data on decentralised storage. But then all of these small interactions would result in transactions and state changes on the blockchain - that would cost a ton of Gas in the current state of Ethereum. That is also why we do it in a Web 2.0/database kind of way.

We are open sourcing our solution and could offer you more insights when it is finished. It might be a good starting point for you as well.

I believed that Ocean allows data sales without losing control over the IP on the data - this is especially useful for machine learning/AI tasks. The algorithms can train a model on data without the data leaving the owners premesis. This enables data usage that was not possible before e.g. for medical data.

Additionally it also enables the creation of datatokens and liquidity pools for datasets which allow for price discovery, curation and reputation of datasets. High quality datasets will have different setups of their datatokens than unsuccessful ones.

You can see very different datatoken models evolving already on the marketplace - there are datasets that are more like startups where the infrastructure and data is being created for the dataset after the initial offering, there are tooling and statistic datasets but also datasets by companies that have created them for other purposes and are now selling them on the Ocean marketplace. Those will for sure not be the only types of data that will be offered.

port.oceanprotocol.com and then a round of voting is taking place here: vote.oceanprotocol.com
After that the winning proposals get 10.000 $OCEAN tokens each. This happens once per month. In the first round there were 5 proposals that got grants, in the second 9 and in the last one this month 12 proposals.

But the team also spends tokens for other programs like the Ambassador program (around 6000 tokens per month) and the Shipyard program (not sure how much is spent there).

The network rewards schedule is not in full force now. The OceanDAO is acting as the first step in that direction but the token distribution is now very controlled and not too many tokens are issued per month.",,

There is a fixed supply that is released over time until the year 2050 to enable projects/proposals to further push the ecosystem. Until then the Web3 sustainability loop will kick in and the whole system can carry itself. So then the data marketplaces will pay fees of their usage to the OceanDAO funds which are then again distributed to the ecosystem etc.
There is also a bit of burning happening in between. The article I linked regarding the Web3 sustainability loop is a description of the goal system in the future.",,

Are there any benefits to putting that on Ocean even if we would be the only ones staking the dataset for our product launching endeavors? Is it possible to restrict the use of the dataset once it is up and running? The other is a group of 500+ dna kits that are a match to each other. It's a group I manage. I see how possibly we could create a form that pulls the dna into reports for  the relevant gene novo markers that influence inflammation, and  other biological processes our wellness ingredients modulate. Not sure how this would work. Maybe more in the category of added value? Last question is how does machine learning work? I know it's something I should google. Would we need to build something on top that uses A.I to more readily find the patterns we are looking for?

With this technology your partners can share their data without having to make it downloadable. Instead researchers and buyers of the dataset can run algorithms on the data without exposing the data itself. So this enables you to drastically restrict the use of the dataset.

AI can create insights for you but this does not happen automatically. You still have to do something to get the results that you want. If you find someone to do the AI engineering for you then this would be possible via this way of sharing the data.
But these AI services are not included just by sharing the data.",,

There are projects that can help you with hosting the dataset as well as consult you on the application of algorithms to it.
This is an agency that is working with companies to publish datasets on the marketplace. They already host some datasets and can give you insights from their personal experience. Additionally they are running an analytics dataset on top of the marketplace so they have insights into what is going on. I think it would be a good idea to connect to them:

1) How can a make sure that the logic of my algorithm stays private?

https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2021-hackathon/issues/5

neuroscientists will be *very well* represented but it would be great to have some other folks interested in the overlap between web3, compute2data, distributed cloud services, and mad neuroscience 🧪 

give this a thumbs up if you're considering attending, and i'll submit an ""unconference"" to the hack-a-thon to do a web3/ocean seminar and help break the ice a little bit 🧊

some other titles from the program:
🗣""The age of the researcher is over. The time of the community has come.""
🗣️ ""Panel discussion: what constitutes clean, scientific code?""

PRODUCT | Compute-to-Data has landed in #OceanMarket! It enables buying & selling of private data while preserving privacy.
CtD resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data & the risks of exposing it.
Full overview: https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/compute-to-data-is-now-available-in-ocean-market-58868be52ef7
#TheYearOfScaling

""With Compute-to-Data, data never leaves its owner’s premises.

• Data owners can monetize data while preserving privacy & control
• Yet data buyers can create value from it with analytics, AI modeling & more

🌊 All via the Ocean Market interface. Try it:
https://market.oceanprotocol.com""

""CtD benefits AI practitioners:
• They can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models. And w/o liability – they don’t see the data.
• They can also publish & monetize their algorithms. These can even stay private (!)""

""Businesses and entrepreneurs can quickly launch their own Ocean-powered data marketplace for their vertical. 

Ocean Compute-to-Data helps them further preserve their sellers’ privacy, and support more compute & AI flows.""

""Here’s a technical overview of Ocean Compute-to-Data:
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/compute-to-data

And here’s how to write algorithms for it:
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-algorithms/""

""CtD in Ocean Market is a major milestone in our 2021 roadmap & a big step towards our vision of data as a new asset class📍

https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/roadmap

We invite you to try out CtD, to explore, to stress-test, and to tell us how it goes! We welcome all feedback 💬""",,"👍🏼 (13),👍 (8),🥳 (12),🌊 (12),🔥 (4),🚀 (8),🧜‍♀️ (4),🍻 (3),3lmac (1)"

> Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that allows individuals and businesses to easily unlock the value of their data and monetize it through the use of ERC-20 based datatokens.
> 
> Through Ocean Protocol, publishers can monetize their data while preserving privacy and control, whereas consumers can now access datasets that were previously unavailable or difficult to find. These datasets can be discovered on the Ocean Market, where they can be purchased and later consumed or sold.
> 
> On Ocean Protocol, each data service is represented by a unique datatoken, which is used to wrap a dataset or compute-to-data service — this essentially allows third-parties to perform operations on the data without it ever leaving the secure enclave of the publisher.
> 
> OCEAN is a utility token that is used for community governance and staking on data, in addition to buying and selling data as the basic unit of exchange on the Ocean Market. The price of these datatokens is set by an OCEAN-datatoken AMM pool, which adjusts the price of the datatoken as it is bought and sold based on supply and demand.",,

Staking is also possible via $ODollars of OpenDAO here: https://odollar.opendao.io
Check out the blogpost about it here: http://bit.ly/3fBehl2
And a tutorial on how to use it here: http://bit.ly/2OdIiMA 

Other staking platforms that support Ocean token staking:
- Balancer
- Uniswap
- Secret Bridge
- Secret AMM
- C.R.E.A.M
- Sushiswap
- WASP

All have their unique risks, advantages and disadvantages. Please DYOR and stake responsibly.",,

Because the smart contracts that the Ocean token can be used with integrate additional functionalities that extend what ETH tokens are capable of doing. To achieve the same with the ETH token, the Ocean Protocol team would have to patch this functionality into the ETH token functions - and that is what everyone for all utility tokens would have to do.
But that would make the ETH token a very messy and risky endeavour if everyone would put their functionality on top of it. So the ERC20 token standard was invented to enable other projects e.g. Ocean Protocol to build their own tokens on top of ETH.",,"👍 (2),💯 (1)"

 to launch their trust infrastructure for a safer internet on #OceanMarket, and to build mechanisms to share data between the two platforms.

#TheYearOfScaling

👉 https://t.co/WhVyDv7ppZ?amp=1

Together, we'll be creating trust profiles of data providers & consumers, data sets & other entities on #OceanMarket. Users will be able to rate & review these, generating trust scores for them. #Blockchain tech rewards trustworthy actors & prevents manipulation of ratings.

🔐 @UTU_trust's vision is to make the internet a safer, more trusted place to gather, share, work, and trade. Fees for software dev & UTU API usage will be funded by the Ocean Protocol Foundation, and the bulk of the work will be completed by Q4 2021.

1) Size of the market- currently a dormant market 
Multi trillion dollars 
This is for two main reasons:
-Privacy concerns (GDPR)
-Not wanting to sell information to competition.

2) Ocean doesn’t really have any direct competitors as Ocean is providing tools for people to create their own marketplace. Ocean is also leagues ahead in terms of partnerships and compute to data will is an incredible piece of technology.

3. SWOT
Strengths are obviously the team, the tech and the community.
Opportunities- Unlcoking the data economy for average people and SME
Weaknesses-  The biggest one I can think of is big companies like google not sharing their data but judging by GAIA X and their partnerships they have I suspect they might come round to changing their mind.

In short when looking at a company such as ocean, you need to look at three main things:
1) The Team
2) what the full fledged project will look like upon completion
3) Partnerships and accomplishments to date

Ocean excels above and beyond in all of these areas. I hope this answers your question!",,

A new token offers the opportunity to add new properties to it. Ocean Protocol does that extensively - they offer the opportunity to launch datatokens using Ocean tokens, vote on OceanDAO grant rounds, and curate datasets with them as well as speculate on data assets.
None of these would be possible with ETH or BTC as the team is not in control of adding additional properties these tokens.

But the most important factor is the OceanDAO grants and the Web3 sustainability loop coupled with it. This is impossible to do without an Ocean token and guarantees the long term growth and health of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. Checkout this article for more details:

Ocean Protocol doesn't rely on the OCEAN to buy & sell data. The Ocean smart contracts and drivers allow for any token to be used, in any exchange setting, since datatokens are ERC20 tokens. Ocean Market app has chosen to use OCEAN  to buy / sell / stake Ocean datatokens. Other apps can use other tokens. For example BDP Market uses BDP tokens. Ocean Market itself will move to using an OCEAN-backed stablecoin when the tech is ready.
This is all fine from an OCEAN perspective, because using OCEAN as a unit-of-exchange doesn't help drive fundamental value. Even more importantly, OCEAN token has been designed to have strong core value drivers: (a) increase in Ocean usage -> increase in network revenue -> increase in OCEAN burned; (b) governance token to allocate funding towards growth of OCEAN; and more. Details are at https://oceanprotocol.com/token. Hope that is a bit clearer. If you have any curiosities about Ocean, feel free to ask. ☺️",,👍 (1)

A good react developer with a crypto background can fork and set it up in 1-2 hours. (by forking Ocean Market - https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market

From scratch, same react dev can do it in 3-4 hours (depending on their CSS capabilities) using our React hooks - https://github.com/oceanprotocol/react

With react, a good html dev (with crypto know how) can built it from scratch in 5-6 hours (depending on their CSS capabilities) using directly ocean.js - https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js

** Non-crypto devs**

If dev is new to crypto, it is advised to understand how web3 wallets works and how smart contract works. A good starting point is our community created super-cool academy modules. - https://oceanacademy.io/

Once they acquire crypto understanding, then above estimations apply.

*It is adaptable to the point where there is zero-recognition or traceability back to the original form. For example, a user could take a structured table, cleanse it, join it with another data set, execute multiple calculations and end up with an unstructured PDF report or visualization that bears little or no resemblance to the original sources. If you start with unstructured data the traceability is even less.
*It is highly substitutable. For example, there may be many options available for sourcing company data and while there will be differences in coverage, timeliness and general reliability the data itself is substitutable.
*It is exceptionally diverse. Not only is the specific data diverse, but so are the formats, delivery mechanisms, frequency of update, terms and pricing. This makes it highly complex and difficult for people to engage with.
***It is often ‘raw’. The data that is available is rarely ready to support all of the diverse use cases for which it may be applicable meaning the consumer spends significant resources adapting it to a specific use case.**
*It is digital and easy to copy. This makes data easy to steal and coupled with a lack of traceability means it’s risky",,

We believe this will be a useful addition to many compute to data environments as it will save effort and cost when performing compute-to-data model developments.

I’m not part of ocean protocol but I’ll try to answer some questions. 

Regarding spam datasets. Are you looking at “main” or including “test” too? Many users will first post datasets/algos to the test networks to familiarize themselves prior to main. It’s may also be used by the team for debug/testing… I believe Trent has posted some branin datasets. I imagine data farming and the work with UTU may help filter out ‘bad actors’ https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-will-introduce-ratings-reviews-thanks-to-utus-trust-infrastructure-b8a63c37c9d9",,

1. In addition to what was said above, We cannot prevent spam. But you can go for a process to add datasets to purgatory. A complaint can be registered with reason/proof that falls under the existing policy on Ocean Market.
Please find the below link: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md

2. The supply is distributed to platforms according to the liquidity provided on them and that which is made available for yield farming on various platforms too. There is no cause for concern.

3. We will make available announcement when we have a new listing.

4. We have media platforms which you can interact and have discussions in addition to the discord channels available",,👍 (2)

""Compute Provider sells compute on data, instead of data itself. They can be the same actor as the Data Provider; **or they can be separate from the Data Provider and trusted by the Data Provider to compute on the data**. ""

Nowhere on your website (https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data) is this distinction made (again), however.

So here's the question: with Compute-to-Data, would it really be possible to have a Compute Provider separate from (but trusted by) the Data Provider?",,

The Gaia-X updated architecture is out with some nice surprises👇

https://t.co/Fb1UhJqJNT

While describing the Gaia-X model, the document also features concepts crucial to the #Web3 economy like #decentralization, dlt, DAOs, token usage in #data infrastructures, and tools like trust frameworks that enable secure service offerings.

Ocean’s vision for a #newdataeconomy is closely aligned with Gaia-X and both organizations share a long-standing collaboration to advance the future of data sovereignty. How about you see what we’re building together for yourself?👇#theyearofscaling

I'm new to the space and just made it through Ocean's technical whitepaper, so my question may be naive and have a simple answer: Wrapping the datasets as ERC20 tokens make a lot of sense, but it also implies that one wallet, or individual, is making the transaction and acquiring the ownership rights to a dataset. If the customer is a curious self-employed data scientist, then perfect! However, I would expect that traditional web2 corporate entities would be one such customer of these datasets. 

Does Ocean have any tooling or guides to aid in selling access to corporate entities rather than, say, a specific employee at the company who used their personal metamask for the transaction? What are the current workarounds?",,✅ (1)

After 3+ years of serving Ocean community as part of the Ocean core team, I have decided to leave my current position as Ocean core team member. 

My belief in the dataverse narrative is stronger than ever 💪. And Ocean Protocol is at the core of leading this growth story. I will stay close to the project and help grow this dataverse narrative. 

I want to personally thank everyone who supported me in the past and to those who continue their support to grow Ocean Protocol 🙏",,"🍻 (8),🤝 (2),🎉 (1)"

Potentially this wallet that you are mentioning here is used by someone to test certain cases in a programatic way and each time they run their code another dataset gets published. There is a purgatory where fraudulent or otherwise unlisted datasets can be proposed here:

I've argued before that token projects are putting the carriage before the horse and it's the case here too. If truly rational decisions were being made, then data assets could simply be priced with e.g. RAI, USDC, DAI. It'd be a 1-line change in the code.

Today, we're helping by providing insights to investors and data consumers about a data token's market health. We've been active in the community since more than a year now and so you might know some of us from GitHub. 

If you're holding OCEAN, we'd appreciate if you voted ""YES"" for Rug Pull Index. We have, as always, submitted a very detailed proposal of how we're spending the money and what things we've achieved. We want to use those funds as transparently as possible and consider ourself a public good that is available to anyone. 

Our proposal is here: https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/rugpullindex-com-improving-the-data-economys-safety/1169?u=timdaub

I am personally in support for Sosa to estimate a cost / track hours so we can proactively/retroactively get a grants in place to pay for his work.

The research highlights how Ocean enables the monetization of private data while preserving privacy. @PalmerBTIG

Check out the full report: https://bit.ly/31s7mpT

Leveraging blockchain technology to put users in control of their data, the report branded Ocean as a strong ""alternative to data monopolies"". 

Main highlights: 

white_check_mark The protocol, by creating tools for manipulating data infrastructures, unlocks “data legos.”

white_check_mark Through OCEAN tokens, users are incentivized to make valuable data available, while maintaining its confidentiality. 

white_check_mark Ocean Market–a decentralized exchange (DEX) tuned for data, allows for dynamic pricing of data sets with a Balancer-powered automated market maker (AMM).

white_check_mark The growth and long-term sustainability of Ocean is ensured by @OceanDAO_ providing community-curated grants.

white_check_mark Ocean Protocol’s V4 is coming soon and will include several improvements for rug pulls and tokenizing copyrights on data

It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it. 

Compute-to-Data on Ocean Market fits this need perfectly:
First, Data Publishers approve AI algorithms to run on their data. These algorithms could be published by Raven Protocol or other third parties.
Then, Compute-to-Data orchestrates remote computation and execution on data to train AI models.

In Ocean, a Compute-to-Data infrastructure is set up as a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on, for example, AWS or Azure in the background. This Kubernetes cluster is responsible for running the actual compute jobs, out of sight for marketplace clients and end-users. While this is an incredible feat in itself, users and Data Publishers may want an alternative option in the Compute Providers they choose to approve. 

Federated learning provides the decentralized option when choosing a Compute Provider.

On top of that, it also ensures an additional layer of privacy for Ocean Compute-to-Data. Third parties could publish, for example, a Federated Learning algorithm. When run, a neural network is randomly initialized. Weight updates are computed next to the data itself in a data silo and then sent to the neural network. This is repeated in data silo #1, data silo #2, data silo #3, and so on. A neural network gets trained across many data silos without data leaving the premises of each respective silo.",,

So Compute-to-Data inherently eliminates privacy concerns and so accomplishes a lot of the value of federated learning naturally. Then for those that want full guaranteed privacy, they can have an algorithm create equally weighted dummy sets of all the underlying datasets and run the ML model on these dummy sets instead of on the original raw data sets. The latter seems a bit of overkill if Compute to Data protects the raw data anyway, but I can see how the additional security would be needed for highly sensitive data. Would this be correct or would I be missing an aspect?",,

Why I find this promising?

A) Have been on the fence so far wrt Data tokens and offerings so far, would be curious on having an experience with this.
B) This will increase the experience of Ocean community with the existing data-tokens that are part of the active pooling
C) Biased familiarity of course, so I've gone ahead and registered already.

What I would suggest?

A) Blogpost on how the Airdrop will work & how you are curating the airdrop choices.
B) Once the Airdrop happens, how can the average community engage with the liquidity pools that are active
C) An expectation of what behavior you expect for the data-token receivers.",,

Even if you are an established project/contributor, I think it's really constructive to be asking ourselves ""What does the DAO need?""

If anyone is interested in learning more about how to contribute and be rewarded for it, please feel free to reply to this post.
There are many work streams that we're setting up inside of OceanDAO, such as with the PGWG and Ambassador's Activity Mining.",,

Here’s Santiago from ITRMachines.

As proponents and winners of the 13th grant round we have been working in the implementation of a library that will allow Ocean developers to make a seamless integration with the AI library known as TensorflowJs.

 Today we present Oceanai-js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/oceanai-js), a plug and play library distributed on npm and ready to use with any kind of NodeJs or Typescript project.
 
In the coming days we will be announcing a workshop (this is our linkedIn handle: https://www.linkedin.com/company/itrmachines/) were we will showcase the advantages of using oceanai-js and how to use the library. The library is public so anyone can download it, use it, and of course alert us of any kind of bug or problem that arises when making use of it.",,

It allows communities to aggregate on-chain and off-chain data/content into a single user experience. I took a look around to see all the content you're creating, and what this COULD look like is a mobile app, dashboard, or website that has your blog posts, youtube videos, logged in user's token balance, governance polls, POAPs, and maybe even Ocean Academy.

https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/776848812534398986/947329717273497600

I recommend participants use the portal to submit their proposals for R15.

The portal helps to solve a lot of the manual work that we have to do behind the scenes. 
We'll be making the portal mandatory starting in R16.

All the best!",,

Our infra capabilities have scaled and we were also piloting with them an NFT drop feature for audences. Now we are going to test the marketplace with that size of an upload and share data tokens with Swarm team to access.

I like to make memes for example.",,

Yes, similar in the sense that they were/are both essential for the ongoing IR. Oil was necessary for the last IR, and data essential for the 4IR. 

However, oil has such bad connotations. Makes me think of drilling up the ground and fracking in order to release fossil fuels. Where data is created regardless, and can be used for a variety of use cases. 

So yes, essential, but but bad connotations.",,

It is about our own Marketplace on some custom URL like https://market.domain.tld with https://provider.domain.tld

1. Is this `serviceEndpoint` is a part which is stored on the Chain
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/did-ddo/#rules-for-did--ddo
> An asset has a DID and DDO. The DDO should include metadata about the asset, and define access in at least one service. Only owners or delegated users can modify the DDO.

> All DDOs are stored on-chain in encrypted form to be fully GDPR-compatible.

https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/did-ddo/#services
> Services define the access for an asset, and each service is represented by its respective datatoken.

DDO contain Services (e.g. Provider URL) and it is stored on the Chain.

Can someone confirm that this is correct?

2. How can we update Provider URL of the already published datasets?
https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/did-ddo/#rules-for-did--ddo
> An asset has a DID and DDO. The DDO should include metadata about the asset, and define access in at least one service. Only owners or delegated users can modify the DDO.

Looks like DDO contain information about the service and DDO can be modified by the asset owner.

Where we can find more information about this and specificaly how to change `serviceEndpoint` attribute for already published DDO?",,

⚡Data owners can monetize their data while maintaining privacy and control.
⚡Data consumers can access private data without liability of directly seeing private data.
⚡AI practitioners & data scientists can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models to improve research and business outcomes.
⚡AI practitioners can also publish their own algorithms,allowing them to earn passive income every time their algorithm is downloaded or run as part of a Compute Job. They can even retain privacy of the algorithms themselves.
⚡Businesses and entrepreneurs can quickly launch their own data marketplace for their vertical, and leverage Compute-to-Data to preserve their sellers’ privacy and support more compute & AI flows.",,

Earlier detection of cancer leads to earlier treatment, saving lives. A friend of mine builds Genetic Programming models to predict cancer. He’s happy if he has a dataset of 100 points, which, alas, means his models have poor predictive ability. Furthermore, each hospital site has bias due to differences in data collection, like how long a sample sits in a Petri dish before it’s measured. What if we could build models from data in 10 or 100 or more hospitals, while preserving privacy? There’s a way: bring the compute to the data, and build a model across hospitals using federated learning.
This is the direction for ConnectedLife, working on Parkinson’s, and leveraging Ocean Web3 data substrate.

Using H2O reduces volatility of data prices compared to using OCEAN directly.  This will benefit various users: data providers will have more predictable revenue; data consumers will have more predictable cost; and datapool stakers will have reduced risk of impermanent loss.,,

It has been pointed out that you had created a project, but failed to take the 2nd step and create a proposal.
The OceanDAO team is trying to provide support for another project so you can submit as well.
If you could please go to https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016934161879080, and ping either Roberto or @Trizin (berkay), we'll provide support there. You will also need 500 OCEAN in the wallet that will receive funding.

Their people have boots-on-the-ground AI-style problems to solve, and they have data. But they aren’t connected to the people that know how to solve the problems — the data scientists. We could do one-off connections via networking. Or we can scale it up in a Web3 data substrate for an AI Commons.

The role of Big Data in Artificial Intelligence ❓ 

Artificial Intelligence needs data to build its intelligence, both initially, subsequently and continuously. The larger the amount of data that Artificial Intelligence systems can access, the more machines can learn and therefore more accurate and efficient their results will be.

As AI becomes smarter, less human intervention is required when it comes to process control and machine monitoring. Artificial Intelligence lives in a continuous learning phase in which it feeds on data continuously.

Just as Big Data is necessary for Artificial Intelligence, the same goes the other way around.

Do you know ❓ What exactly is the data economy, and why should it matter to you? And how can you lay the foundations for success in this world of near-boundless information?
📌 
The data economy represents global supply and demand for live data, data applications, and data services.

Succeeding in the data economy, or becoming a ""Data Economy Leader,"" requires deploying technology, executing organization-wide strategies, and using data in ways that were unthinkable to organizations just a few years ago. 

It all begins with three tried-and-true pillars: 📌 people 📌 process, and 📌 technology.",,

DDL: 📅15 Jun @ 10:00 AM UTC
This process is compulsory for pools with >500 $OCEAN Reserve. 

36 datasets have been highlighted to meet the minimum threshold of $OCEAN reserve, see the full list here:
🌊For pools with less than 500 $OCEAN in reserve, the gas fees for a data pool migration exceed the amount of $OCEAN locked. Thus, no action is required and datatoken holders will be compensated for the amount they staked directly.
Important:

Any LP that does not lock their pool shares by the deadline, will still be able to withdraw their stake but will NOT receive the 10% bonus.
What comes next? 👀💥

The Migration Day has been scheduled for 15 Jun 2022 ✅

All pool shares and datatokens will be burned, and airdrops will be sent to all those eligible in the Polygon network.",,

I just started to invest in crypto last winter. Data integration and adoption seems to be a narrative worth exploring. Long story short, I have probably watched 10 videos on ocean protocol and absolutely am floored by what I see. About to do a deep dive on mediums and articles as well. I just found out about ocean and it’s been here since 2017! Anyways, glad I’m here and eager to learn all I can. I may ask newb type of questions just to warn y’all. 👋",,

Any data with unknown form or the structure is classified as unstructured data. In addition to the size being huge, un-structured data poses multiple challenges in terms of its processing for deriving value out of it. A typical example of unstructured data is a heterogeneous data source containing a combination of simple text files, images, videos etc. Now day organizations have wealth of data available with them but unfortunately, they don’t know how to derive value out of it since this data is in its raw form or unstructured format.",,

My name is Selcuk and I'm reaching out on behalf of PrimeDAO which provides crucial infrastructure and accessible tools within the DAO ecosystem for incumbents and new players. One of our product Prime Launch is a platform to host reliable and fair token launches on multiple chains. We have seed launch and LBP (Balancer V2) options available. We are not just launching tokens, also we curate them, we accelerate them and we invest them with our partners!  As I ve seen OceanDAO community grants; there are synergies between our two parties and we’d love to explore ways to collaborate. Appreciate if someone DM me regarding this topic.
 
Cheers,

Solve rug pulls. In Ocean V3, a publisher would get all initial datatokens; malicious publishers could then rug pull. For V4, the publisher gets no initial datatokens. Instead, when someone adds OCEAN liquidity to a datatoken pool, a special one-sided staking bot mints enough datatokens into the pool to keep price constant. Similarly, when OCEAN liquidity is removed, the bot burns datatokens. Since the publisher is not a whale at the outset, they have nothing to rug pull (!). This mechanic also eliminates slippage when adding/removing OCEAN liquidity.
Data NFTs. We NFT-ize base IP to enable transfer of the base IP itself, to support >1 revenue streams on the base IP, to accumulate value to the base IP before monetization, and to leverage the recent growth of tooling in the NFT ecosystem. ERC20 datatokens remain as before: licenses to use the base IP.
Help community monetize. Now, 3rd party marketplaces can earn fees on from swapping, staking, and consuming (versus V3 just consuming), and have more control over fee rates (vs V3 hardcoded). V4 also includes architecture for >1 datatoken type, for more flexible fees, pay-as-you-go Compute-to-Data, and more.
Ocean V4 will include tooling to help migrate data assets and pools from Ocean V3. Ocean V4 will initially get deployed to all the same EVM chains as V3: Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Moonriver, Energy Web Chain. After that, we plan to deploy to more EVM chains over time.",,🧐 (1)

A vulnerability exists in Ocean pools where one could stake, buy datatokens, unstake, and then sell datatokens.

In certain pools with sufficient liquidity, this can be profitable and when performed repeatedly, will result in a portion of OCEAN being drained from the pool.

This vulnerability is mitigated with an increase in the swap fee to 15%. Thus, a new fee of 15% has been set and is live. Proceeds from this fee go back to the Ocean community.

We are looking at further measures to eliminate this attack vector and we’ll come back to you when we have something to report. 

Ocean Protocol has taken a snapshot and anyone that has taken a loss will be compensated.

Following feedback from the community and recent learnings, we are introducing veOCEAN to best align the incentives of token holders and liquidity providers.  

Continue reading 👇 <https://t.co/Cme16cby0x>

How?🌟 

veOCEAN holders can lock their $OCEAN tokens over a time period to earn rewards and voting power. The longer the lock period, the higher the rewards and the voting power.

They can also vote on proposals and earn rewards, both from consume fees and data farming.

veOCEAN holders can earn passive rewards, solely by locking their $OCEAN. 

Or, they can be active by allocating veOCEAN to higher-quality datasets for greater earnings.

Going forward, veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits.

When? ⏰

$85,000 USD in OCEAN are available for Web3 data economy projects that will build on Ocean and contribute to its growing ecosystem!🌊

DDL - Aug 2 @ midnight UTC

Round 20 will be geared towards 👇
 
✅Biasing to those who engage for the love of doing it. An engaged, diverse community.

✅Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results. 

✅More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking overhead

Approaches to improving OceanDAO⚒

🌊Starting with R21, the main pillar will be retroactive grants only for outcomes already achieved.

🌊OceanDAO will give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced ones, by capping the total funding amount for a project.

Round 20 Changes 👀

💡Total funding of 75,000 USD (min.)

💡100,000 USD max. per project in a lifetime

💡100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)

Funding ceiling per tier

💡New projects - 3K USD 

💡Existing projects -  7.5K USD (have completed one grant from OceanDAO)

💡Experienced projects - 15K USD (have completed two or more grants)

In the next Round 21, we will also introduce the following 👇

🚀Retroactive Grants - Projects will apply for grants that fund the outcome of work they did, not plan to do

🚀2 Months Cycle per Round - Total funding of 150,000 USD available

🚀New funding ceilings per tier

You are encouraged to submit proposals early via the Proposal Portal. Note that proposals can no longer be submitted through Ocean Port directly.

You can find a better alternative and staking option here;  veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits. https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1546878528813400064",,

Hey buddy, Datatoken pools will not be available from now on. Please see disclaimer above. 

You can find a better alternative and staking option here;  veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits. https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1546878528813400064",,

Go to <https://market.oceanprotocol.com/> and remove your $OCEAN NOW 

🚨 Remember: Removing liquidity after July 31st will still be possible via Etherscan, however it's highly recommended to remove any remaining liquidity from Ocean Market now to prevent further losses.

Three ways to bundle NFTs (data NFTs or otherwise):
1. Send NFTs to a 1-of-1 multisig. Transfer via temporary 1-of-2. Eg via Gnosis Safe.
2. Send NFTs into an NFT-ized eth address. Eg Emblem Vault.
3. Group NFTs via a token-grouping protocol. Eg ERC998

#SrikanthKaja, General Manager and Principal Architect of Emerging Technologies at Daimler SE Asia, is discussing #Acentrik, a decentralized data marketplace now in Enterprise Release that uses Ocean technology, in the latest #VotDE episode with host @dikshadutta.

Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],647661378198306821,mickssp,08/04/2022 6:34 AM,"Oceaners, big waves are coming! 🌊 

We're thrilled to announce that the integration with @H2O_data is completed, and $H2O is now available in Ocean Market. 

$H2O will enable data buyers and sellers to benefit from more price stability.

How? Let's take a quick look 👀

What is H2O and why is it important? 💧 

✅$H2O is an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by @reflexerfinance.

✅$H2O is decentralized, permissionless, minimizes governance and typically settles at ~$1.60

Since data can now be priced in $H2O, and $H2O fluctuates far less than $OCEAN, users can benefit from very little exposure to volatility in Ocean Market. This will bring two near-term benefits:

1️⃣  First, data sellers get more predictable revenue as revenue is no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.
2️⃣ Second, data buyers have more predictable costs as costs are no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.

❔How do I get $H2O tokens?
Locking OCEAN to mint $H2O via the H2O dapp here: https://app.h2odata.xyz  
Buy $H2O in an exchange such as the Uniswap: https://buff.ly/3ysO2p5

I will like to take this oportunity to precent our latest development to the community that is Oceanai-py.

The current state of the library allows developers to connect directly to the Ocean-lib service provider modules, and to obtain datasets using the already stablished Ocean market pipeline. Once the datasets are retrieved Oceanai-py allows for an easy and quick implementation of the ai model of your preference, this is done using Tensorflow as an engine.

If you are a developer, and would like to know more, we invite you to check https://github.com/itrm-team/oceanai-py or in https://pypi.org/project/oceanai-py/, to see how can you make use of the library.

Also, I will like you to invite you to our official Discord server https://discord.gg/kAPY3pPC as it will be hosting an AMA about the library that we just made public , the AMA will be taking place at 9:00 AM GMT-5, this 2th of September

We are very grateful for the support that the community has been showing and very excited to continue the contributions to the ecosystem.",,

Get ready, Oceaners! 🛠️

👀veOCEAN goes live next Monday (Sep 26). Data Farming will resume three days later (Thursday)!🌊

Let's dive into the details!👇

⁉️What is veOCEAN? 
 It is the main mechanism for locking $OCEAN and for curating datasets on Ocean - it’s lower risk than datatoken pools, and delivers more benefits.

What can I do with veOCEAN?👇
✅ Lock $OCEAN to receive veOCEAN, and earn passive rewards. 

✅ Use veOCEAN to curate data with high Data Consume Volume (DCV) and get even more rewards.

✅ Vote on @OceanDAO_ proposals

Here is an overview of the timeline⏰

📅Sep 26: veOCEAN goes live. Lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN at http://df.oceandao.org

📅Sep 29: Counting for Data Farming /DF5 resumes

📅Oct 6: DF5 payouts resume. Counting starts for DF6

📅Oct 13: DF6 payout; DF7 counting starts

Please note ⚠️

DF will follow phases as before. When it resumes, it will be with a new “VE/DF Alpha” phase for 4 weeks. “DF Beta” and “DF Main” phases will follow, as previously targeted.

Want to know more? 🤔

🔘Ocean: transferable, used for incentives by issuance;
🔘ve: non-transferable, locked in by depositing the base token into a voting escrow contract, with a term of 1 week to 4 years; ve lockers vote on which permit pools should be incentivized and accumulate all protocol fees.  

Here come three important deviations from the standard:

1. Weekly emissions are adjusted as a percentage of circulating supply (Total Supply Ocean - ve Locked Supply). 
As more tokens are vested, the impact of emission is decreased.

2. ve lockers increase their holdings proportional to the weekly emission. The goal is to ensure that ve lockers are never diluted. 

3. Ve locks are NFTs. By tokenizing the lock position this allows a single address to own more than one lock, locks balances are cumulative and each lock contributes to the overall ve balance. This further allows locks to be traded on secondary markets.",,

Community fees: Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO grants, etc. All earnings here are passive.

Data Farming: veOCEAN holders will get each weekly DF rewards allocation, except a small carveout for DF Crunch. For DF rewards, veOCEAN holders can be passive, though they will earn more if active. “Being active” means allocating veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs). Then, rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * stake. But now, stake is the amount of veOCEAN allocated to the data asset, rather than liquidity in a datatoken pool. (And this stake is safe: you can’t lose your OCEAN as it is merely locked.)",,👍🏻 (1)

DF week 5 has now concluded🚜👩‍🌾

💰10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available for this round and all the LPs can claim their rewards 👀🌊

Let's see how you can do it!👇

✅Visit the DF webapp Claim Portal at https://df.oceandao.org
✅Connect your Wallet
✅For each network where you staked: select network, click “Claim”, sign the TX, get rewards

👩‍🌾Rewards will accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound gains.

The counting for DF6 begins this week and ends October 13th @ 12:01 AM UTC. 

Catalyzed by recent events, veOCEAN effectively replaces pools as the DF staking mechanism.

Want to find out more about the current status of rewards?

-there  are many datasets available for purchase on the marketplace and you can find them here:
https://market.oceanprotocol.com/

-The review process works in the form of purgatory which allows people  to submit requests to block, datasets that violates the existing policy of the Ocean Market
Datasets that are considered to violate the rules are reported and removed from the marketplace.
You can check out the rules here:

Welcome 🙂 We are working hard to attract more data scientists to our young platform to publish data and algos!

While we don’t review for bias in datasets, we do have a process of reviewing datasets for inappropriate material. Ocean users mostly include data scientists and enthusiasts looking to generate revenue. You can earn revenue by staking your $OCEAN token or by holding your $OCEAN token and getting paid out rewards as datasets are sold.

Question about the Ocean Farm project
I locked a few OCEAN through the app  https://df.oceandao.org/veocean
A message ""successful"" appeared, and my wallet displays a smart contract.
However, my locked OCEAN amount is still at 0 on the app
Does it need time to process the transaction? It's been more than 6 hours now

Once you lock your OCEAN tokens and receive veOcean, then you start generating passive rewards that are claimable weekly on Thursdays. It is recommended to do the data farming also to maximize your possible rewards if you allocate your veOCEAN to different Ocean Market projects.

So....the OceanDao Project that I uploaded in seed.oceandao.org is the one that will be displayed in airtable right? And the proposal I make in ocean port will be read in ocean port right?

It's helpful to grasp:
- Long term, multi-marketplace strategy of Ocean Protocol (part reason of current fee strucuture -> future scale)
- Regulation for Enterprises in Blockchain
-- E.g.: We tweaked our stack with MB to comply with European Regulation/Standards
--- like: making data NFTs non transferable
--- allow for insta-redemption of token, removing the speculative threat (regulation)

Could be an eye-opener, or ""convincer"" for partners you work with. 

Scenarios can include:
- Put your customers data onto Acentrik, do magic from there
- Build your own market, and go with learnings from our work with Mercedes (Regulation)

Just a heads up.

Passive rewards - Dispensed
Active rewards - To be dispensed

Why: We have to wait until the epoch ends to run the calculations and get the rewards out the door. 

There is still a significant amount of work before we automate this and it may be a few more epochs until we get this in place.

Thought I'd share something brief until we have the active rewards distributed and provide an official update on the completion of DF9.

Thank you!",,"✅ (5),👍 (3)"

To be specific about the calculations, let's say you staked amount X on a dataset for the first two days, and then on the third day you allocated your veOCEAN to a different dataset. Then you would get X * 2 / 7 for dataset 1 and also X * 3 / 7 for dataset 2. In other words, you cannot reallocate to a more profitable dataset in the middle of the week and still capture an entire week's worth of DF on that dataset - you get a partial amount depending on the time you reallocate.",,✅ (4)

Consume for DF dataset (https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:81a2c9959bf2a03e7c9b21f95e24b457cb28c880e28e3670cb0a736372d0ad05) was 1000 $OCEAN, Stake was 3.000.000 => 3.000.000.000 DCV if we discount the switch of the tokens for the last 2 days it would be:
1000 $OCEAN * (3.000.000 * 5/7 + 2.000.000 * 2/7) = 1000 $OCEAN * 2.714.000 => 2.714.000.000

Consume for the Clash dataset (https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:3dd05b9f564b9f43609e03121351b83bb1fa0a64b94e5635a3990679318b5dc5) was 25.000 $OCEAN, stake was 1.000.000 => 25000 * 1.000.000 * 2/7 = 7.142.857.142

Which would mean that the Clash dataset should have gotten ~2.5* the reward of the DF dataset.

If I check that with the reward numbers computed in the DF dataset then this does not reflect the reward distribution.

Maybe I am missing something here?",,

RF_ij = (stake_ij/(Σi stake_ij)) * (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j)

We are interested in checking the RF for complete datasets and not individuals, so we remove the i component by adding up all the stakes in the dataset:

RF_j = ((Σi stake_ij)/(Σi stake_ij)) * (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j) = (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j)

So if we look at the last round and consumes of two datasets:
* the DF farming one: RF_df = DCV_df / (Σj DCV_j), and its consumes DCV_df = 1000 $OCEAN
* the Clash of clans one: RF_clash = DCV_clash / (Σj DCV_j) and its consumes DCV_clash = 25000 $OCEAN
* the sum of all the consumes is (Σj DCV_j) = 26.000 $OCEAN

Then this results in RF_df = 1000 / 26000 and RF_clash = 25000 / 26000 - so the RF_clash dataset should have gotten basically all the rewards due to its high DCV.

I am assuming here that RF is always resulting in the share of the total rewards for the round - e.g. if RF = 0.1 and the total rewards are 1000, then the reward would be 100. But the article does not mention this.",,

""Steam Reviews Dataset 2021"" has by far the highest DCV with more than 15k USD sales volume in this round - so stakers would get an APY of 60% here. However, when taking a closer look, the dataset is priced incredibly high with 7.5k USD per usage for a day (so it was sold twice during this round to reach 15k USD sales volume). Although it is kind of outside my circle of competence, I find it hard to believe that someone would pay that much for this dataset.

I personally loved the idea of a BTC-backed stable, but it all breaks down if the system can print the underlying asset to infinity.

Sovryn, being built natively on Rootstock, is a much better, native system, however does not exist beyond the BTC ecosystem.

There are many regulatory and compliance challenges Stables may find themselves in the future, specifically with trying to remain pegged to the USD.

I believe that if you really want to sell this data, it's important to extract more actionable insights and then make it obvious how to extract value from it.

Example, the first way I made money in crypto was selling arbitrage intelligence.
I made it extremely easy for people to see the arb gaps, and close it.
I then added alerts around it so people received notifications.

If you can help people make money, then people are very willing to pay you for it.
If you just deploy data in the market, it may not feel as actionable or valuable.

I have put together this presentation to give an idea of how this can be setup.

I have also shared more discussions around it in #🚜︱data-farming and am looking forward to continue contributing there.
I propose moving the convo to #🚜︱data-farming to keep it going.",,♥️ (1)

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Catarina and I'm conducting academic research on Decentralized AI for my PhD in Business & Strategy at University of Porto.
It would be great if I could talk with someone on the team about the topic applied to sustainability. There isn't any relevant data and research available on DeAI applied on sustainabilty problems.
Would you be able to help me? Or refer someone/papers who are in touch with these matters.

I am the Operations Manager for the Web3 Working Group. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization devoted to education about Web3 infrastructure for people from all backgrounds. Our content focuses on how Web3 infrastructure is distinct from financial services(Defi) and how it can be used to decentralize the web and restore user control of cyberspace. 

We are looking to establish a point of contact(Email/Phone) with a marketing/community lead in your organization in order to help push your announcements about large product updates further by also sharing them on our social media. We aim to be an aggregator for Web3 infrastructure news and a place newcomers can quickly learn about the projects under that umbrella.

Hi everyone, I have kicked off this personal project as a way to support the Ocean Protocol community, and to create a bridge with the Nouns DAO community.

**What is it?**
Ocean Nouns (oceannouns.wtf) is meant to be a community-owned, fund-raising mechanism for ecosystem projects to obtain some pretty fun NFT PFPs that blend the worlds of Nouns DAO (nouns.wtf) with Ocean Protocol .

You can read all about it in the proposal that I linked below!

**How can you support?**
I have submitted a proposal to Nouns Prop House in the hopes of raising money for the project.
You can find the proposal in the tweet below, and I would love to receive your support by linking, retweeting, and just overall engaging with it **(this first tweet, not the second tweet)**.
https://twitter.com/oceannouns/status/1613086424554668032

**If this proposal wins, it would add 10 ETH of funding into the project to: pay for artists, setup an LLC, deploy contracts, and many other important details.**
My goal is to promote the project over the weekend to hopefully increase the number of votes.
Your support with bringing visibility to this tweet would be very helpful and go a long way.

**What else is going on??**
I am currently creating some prototype/mock art that represents many different ecosystem projects, data-engineering and data-science concepts (like the python logo), data arming, and much more. I have attached the first prototype to this messsge.

**Thank you everyone!**",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1063713578961604678/ocean-nouns-ocean-python.png?ex=65e2cdf8&is=65d058f8&hm=f651e69f594cf49b6cebfc041d7fcb193a29bb7d2574511b1606809de3cfbade&,"❤️ (2),🙌 (2)"
