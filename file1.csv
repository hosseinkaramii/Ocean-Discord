(and more generally  data can be securitized.)  for an open data economy  we can and should use the tools of the token economy. tokens themselves are a key tool. datatokens naturally leverages existing cryptographic infrastructure for tokens  such as wallets.datatokens are like apis for transferring data (oceans) within the entire ethereum defi ecosystem. this means that data tokens can naturally use all the tools and protocols that are emerging in defi. in other words: with datatokens  the defi ecosystem gets a whole new class of tokens to work with. datatokens can live side by side with existing tokens such as eth and btc  as well as thousands of other tokens  and be used in existing and future defi applications. data tokens can be used as “first class citizen” financial instruments in defi applications.,,,

(eg climate data as a digital common asset ) the potential of web 3 extends beyond climate research  empowering users with control over their data and digital assets. by embracing blockchain technology  decentralized applications  and protocols  we can create a more secure  private  and user-centric internet. the transition to web 3 is an exciting step towards a decentralized future! 💻🌐🚀,,,

2023-07-24 00:00:00.000,,robinlehmann,194817764236460030,Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💡︱idea-factory [1088534285478269038],did you see any legal opinion by vitadao on ipts? they exclude the u.s. explicitely and claim there are not clear legal terms there. the easy way to do it.  so if you go back in history to the famous orange farm where the howey test was invented - a farmer sells rights to the future oranges that will be grown on a piece of land  thus creating a security as: 1. financial investment - you spend money to acquire your share ✅ 2. shared enterprise - an nft/ip nft gets fractionalised and everyone gets a share ✅ 3. expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others - you are not going to do the research in the case of an ipt  in the case of fractionalising a datanft you are also a passive holder of your fraction while others contribute or sell the data. ✅  it could of course be argued in 3. that you somehow are doing something but i am not a lawyer  for me its clear that your share of the work is not going to bring most of the money  that is why you work with others.  thus you create a security.  in the end a protocol like molecule or other nft fractionalising protocols don't have to care too much about this  as the users of the tech are the ones breaking the law  not the protocols themselves. but the users of the tech like vitadao or someone then creating a fractionalised nft will be legally responsible.  i am not a lawyer  i just follow the crypto space for 6 years now and it is a common theme that people create tech that will put their users in jail in their jurisdiction when they use it  if the government would care enough. so i always recommend caution or to move somewhere where these things don't matter too much.,,,

(1) though having a stable coin makes life easier in initial stages but you are essentially dependent on another coin which you have no say in. your marketplace can suffer significantly is maker community increase lending rates (meaning less dai is available in the market and eventually your marketplace) (2)  dai is a stable coin  it wont appreciate inherently. its value is pegged to usd and it will always be that. so that limits the value capture that an internal token can have. (e.g) knc  bnb etc.  (3) ocean protocol provides all the benefits of first approach (internal currency with potential to appreciate significantly) + marketplace framework + dedicated tech and community support  like i am doing right now ;). all you need to do is just customise marketplace as per your needs and launch. btw ocean protocol also have programs to help with funding if we see potential in your marketplace.,,,

[created issue https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379]   there seem to be two separate concerns. (1) unclear how to handle super-large dataset with many files (2) concern of high initial liquidity needs for valuable dataset. i responded thoroughly in the github issue created. https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379#issuecomment-780686815. let's do further iterations there.  > (2) datasets published before the pump have now increased in value but also the price per token is now 3x higher than before. that will prevent sales. the problem will (hopefully) increase over time.  note that is something that people can arb for  based on what they think the value is denominated in. just like in any other amms in uniswap  balancer  etc.   however we can soften this to reduce the effects of impermanent loss  by "ocean-backed stablecoin in market". that's targeted for q2.  finally  "better staking" (q4) will decouple amount of stake from price.   > (3) whats currently missing in the market is the buy/consume side. to attract real consumers to the market i would consider vouchers for potential consumers to spend on datasets for a limited time. e.g. 2000 ocean to spend on data within 24h.  agreed in this goal. "data farming" (q2) will bring an extra layer of incentives for people to supply / consume data.,,,

(a) compute-to-data where the "compute" is selection of the subset of data. how to price: if you have s / m / l selection sizes  then have one amm for each selection size. you could use this approach in your dataunion app. or ocean market might support it when it fully supports compute-to-data  though this looks like an extra feature on top so it could be a while.  (b) have a different datatoken for each of the 1000+ files; then make a "basket" token to bundle them together  using eg set protocol  balancer (v2 for >8 tokens)  or erc998. one question is how to price. one way is to have an amm for each base item; arbitrage bots will keep prices fairly balanced. another way is to have fixed price on each base item. a second question is what's the best way to bundle; different things would need to be tried. a third q is how to have those bundles in ocean market or otherwise; ocean market will evolve that way starting with ">1 pool per datatoken"  but this could extend.,,,

"arbitrary" is a synonym for "unlimited complexity" human capability to deal with complexity is very limited and human and artificial intelligence is fundamentally different.  what is going to happen if the number of labels is growing in an uncontrolled fashion is that there is no consistency between labels and image content. that will have a significant negative impact on ai and therefore on the value of the dataset. inconsistent and low quality datasets are still the norm today. in order to create and *maintain* a dataset of high value it is imo mandatory to have a fabric that links labels to image content from an ai and *not* a human perspective. to prevent introducing human perception bias into the data i highly recommend to have this in place before starting.,,,
