Os provedores de dados podem publicar seus serviços de dados como ERC721 Data NFTs e ERC20 datatokens, que permitem o controle de acesso descentralizado por meio de token-gating. Para acessar um conjunto de dados ou serviço de dados, é preciso ter os datatokens correspondentes. O consumo de serviços de dados envolve o gasto de datatokens.
O Compute-to-Data permite a compra e a venda de dados privados, preservando a privacidade. Ele permite que os cálculos sejam executados nos dados sem que eles saiam de suas instalações, garantindo que somente os resultados sejam visíveis para o consumidor.
O Ocean Market é um exemplo de um mercado de dados descentralizado em que compradores e vendedores podem trocar dados e algoritmos, com ferramentas para publicar e monetizar a propriedade intelectual usando a tecnologia blockchain.",,

Hi everyone, my name is Tom but more widely known as **endro labs** (https://endro.io) in the cryptospace. I am from a small country called Belgium and got to know Ocean via Dimitri when BigChainDB was still the main focus! My daily endeavours are at Lisk community but i'm also trying to take on bits and pieces in the Polkadot community. My development activities are currently **Arcado Network**, a decentralized gaming environment where the main drive would be to try and bring the world from Ready Player One to life! Some might also know me from **Hallar** (https://hallar.io) which is the meeting ground for future networks and validators for DPOS consensus. The platform is currently targeted at the Lisk Ecosystem but would love to expand it in the future. 

Starting next week, i will be starting as a full-time crypto roamer so hit me up if you want to connect or just have a fun chat 😄 I also have experience with AI as a service (Google, FastAPI, NLP engines, Tensorflow, ..) so hit me up if you need some help or info regarding AI or Blockchain",,"💯 (2),👍 (4),💪 (1)"

the ocean wallet on bittrex has been inactive for weeks. my tokens were not withdrawn successfully, yet they have not been restored to my bittrex wallet either. Bittrex says they can't do anything until the wallet is back online and they made it sound like it was on the Ocean team to get it fixed, and to only check back when it's online but they did not give any timeline.

Not a `blockchain` expert but am working on techniques to bridge between distributed application logic and `smart contract` functionality.

I studied `OceanProtocol` vision and high level design material quite a bit but not yet knowledgeable enough. If you think am missing some point please point me to material that I need to study.

Based on my understanding so far I do have some premises on how my work & focus relate to `OceanProtocol`. 
One of my first goals is to verify those premises with people here and their experiences.

My name is Eduardo and I'm part of the Polkadot Brazilian Team.

I saw several posts on Trello about the Ocean Protocol and got interested in knowing more.

I am initiating contacts to structure a project proposal for a DEFI Tolkens Exchange for the Brazilian market and probably LATAM.

One of the things I would like to develop would be market monitoring robots. With the ability to understand graphic patterns and times to make asset purchase and sale decisions. In addition to arbitration for Flash Loan contracts.

I don't know if that is exactly your focus and I would like to confirm. If so, I believe that this would bring great advantages to our project. And that is the reason for this contact.

Thanks for listening,
Eduardo Cardoso",,🍾 (1)

However - I think between the capabilities Ocean provides combined with some of the more cutting edge features of SAP HANA in particular (oData, standardized in-memory views, adoption of node.js and K8s for extension) make for some exciting possibilities.

My name is David Hunt-Mateo and I'm a software engineer with 7 years of professional experience. For the last three years, I developed a cross-platform, on-device, noise-robust speech recognition library. Users liked it because it would work on whatever hardware they had, it never transmitted their audio to the cloud, and it would work in harsh environments like the middle of the ocean or a noise manufacturing floor. Unfortunately, I was laid off at the end of 2020. Soon after, I began reading about blockchain and was immediately enthralled by the benefits that decentralized Web 3 technologies could bring. I am currently participating in the KERNEL Block 2 fellowship program hosted by Gitcoin. 

I've spent 4 weeks researching to understand the Web 3 landscape and to determine exactly what use cases excited me most. I determined that I am most passionate about the user's right to privacy and data ownership, especially regarding AI and communication. Having developed a production AI system myself, I'm familiar with the massive amounts of data required as well as the difficulties small companies face when trying to acquire data. Furthermore, it's not hard to recognize the tactics that larger companies employ to extract data from their users. I think the Ocean Protocol could provide a solution to these problems, and furthermore, that it is poised for massive growth as the mainstream consciousness becomes aware of the abuse it's suffered at the hands of big tech. 

As such, the Ocean Protocol tops the list of projects I'd like to become involved with. My career has meandered through several industries and many layers of the technology stack. I consider myself a jack of many trades, adept at learning/applying new technologies, and a skilled communicator. My specialties in the past have been cross-platform development, desktop and native Android apps, and embedded software.",,"👍 (2),👏 (2)"

The algorithms can train a model on data without the data leaving the owners premesis. This enables data usage that was not possible before e.g. for medical data.

Additionally it also enables the creation of datatokens and liquidity pools for datasets which allow for price discovery, curation and reputation of datasets. High quality datasets will have different setups of their datatokens than unsuccessful ones.",,"👏 (3),👍🏻 (1)"

We are eyeing Ocean Protocol to make our unique data set available in a decentralized market while integrating data from the OP data marketplace into our Advanced Metrics Analysis & Signaling platform. 

Our analysis platform would enable users to buy the marketplace data they want to use and then crunch numbers in mass with our brute force back tester, possibly publishing results to the marketplace as well. We are still in the research phase for OP integration though our analytics platform is already crunching our own data now.

Well we will focus on nano sensors that ""dig"" up unique data. It is kind of dynamic identities that will make it possible, via AI, to ask material systems like machines and organisms how they are doing. An ontology of a thing.  Initially we will focus on machines and predictive maintenance. It will be possible to do what you ask but as a first step it will as feedback loop.

So the data resides on premise and the access to the data by algorithms is organised via compute-to-data. This means that the data is not going to leave the data storage and that the data owner (you) can allow algorithms to access the data or not.",,

It is an honor to e-meet you. 

I recently completed the OCEAN Academy and I officially became Ambassador 🙂 

I am a Swiss student pursuing a Master in Big Data (at IE University, Spain) and I am currently working at the investment startup Goldfingr (goldfingr.net) as a Business developer. 

I am very intrigued in the Ocean Protocol’s current challenges and on how we can make the company grow, together! I am willing to actively be engaged in the ‘visibility / marketing’ side of the business. 

I work with a Swiss Blockchain enthusiast and we would be thrilled to jump on a call to tell you more about our us and share insights. We recently worked on the elaboration of a WhitePaper and a crypto platform launch. I sincerely believe we can add-up new skills and ideas to the team.

I am hoping that any of you will be able to bring me guidance on the current and future steps to get involved in revolutionary OCEAN Protocol! We are open to discuss anything and start working ASAP!

Looking forward to collaborating with you.

Besides WorkPi we are also building Work X: a decentralized platform economy for work where service providers and customers can work together without intermediaries. 

Because we believe that the personal data of our users should be owned and controlled by themselves, we are working together with the European Commission on a Self-Sovereign Identity solution (SSI). Users will be able to connect their career related data such as assessments, diplomas, certificates or references to their digital passport/identity. This is also where Ocean comes along. It's a great thing to give data back to the people, but is also comes with a challenge: how do we learn from it when the data is scattered around the world? The technology of Ocean is very promising to solve this problem. To this end we introduce *Compute-to-SSI*. Learn more about our proposal here: https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/workpi-oceandao-round-9/862

We're very interested to get to know the community and hear your feedback! 

Cheers! 

Rik",,🔥 (3)

However I have some questions I've been trying to answer through research with no avail. I am trying to understand how Ocean solves the problem of middle and lower class citizens of the world being exploited by having their data used, stolen, locked, etc... without any compensation or benefits - while other organizations and individuals are profiting big time off of their every move from governance, as well as technological developing and ownership. This is the main dilemma of the world, as far as data harvesting and wealth inequality. The top 1% own more resources than the bottom 4 billion people as of today. Yet, almost every human is providing valuable data to the top 1% without receiving any compensation, and while 811 million people are currently starving right now in the world.",,

Maybe consider joining our weekly Town Halls. It's always Wednesdays, 3pm UTC. We celebrate teams and accomplishments there, next to DAO specs and updates, and we have an open floor at the end of every Town Hall where new members and contributors often say Hi (and link with new co-builders or projects):
 https://discord.gg/WHZePqBs?event=966678382664384572

Also, since I see you got some nice NFT design game going as well, it's worth checking if there are projects working with NFTs, also towards dataNFTs, at the moment. 

Again easiest way here is to say Hi in Ocean-DAO channel (above), or, to go to the Ambassadors Channel, with @zippy1979, @blockchainlugano and others,  and ask them for a nice project to contribute to /collab with wrt NFTs. Top of my head this would be projects like Walt.ID, TheDataShift, WeDataNation, RealDataWhale, but definitely more.

Our mission is to use pay-for-success (PFS) smart contracts and IP-NFTs to solve a trillion dollar market failure due to misaligned incentives under patent system and bring an open source business model to biopharma by incentivising the repurposing of generic/off-patent drugs for 1/100th of the cost of patented drugs. I presented at DeSci day in ETHAmsterdam (https://youtu.be/40UeWLDutYo) and we are currently working with Longevity Prize (https://twitter.com/longevityprize) to raise $1m in payer funds for an IP-NFT x PFS pilot to support a Phase 2 clinical trial by Dr Brad Stanfield to use off-patent rapamycin + exercise to improve healthy longevity in the elderly - see attached diagram.

These artists do not have any dedicated platform to be able to sell their artworks as NFTs. On the other hand we want to provide a NFT Marketplace for DAO’s ecosystem.
Art Rate is an NFT Marketplace where artists can convert their Artworks into NFTs and sell them. Moreover, by using our social media platform they are able to get in touch and connect with other artists from all around the world who share common interests.

I am freelancing as a Data Scientist & Technical Writer and would like to move into Blockchain / DAO analysis. Currently, I am looking for gigs in the space. 

So far, my closest job was a recent project where I analyzed arbitrage transactions on Terra on data from Flipside Analytics. Since then, that project has 'stopped' 😅. 

Before that, I played a bit around with blockchain data on BigQuery. I wrote up a few articles about that: https://medium.com/@nocibambi.

In the long term, I would like to produce insights and data products that blockchain projects / DAOs can use. I am especially interested in contribution management, governance, and ownership. However, at the moment, I am happy to contribute in any way (e.g., writing documentation).

It would be nice to hear any tips that might help me to take off, but especially the following:
- Common data/analytics challenges blockchain projects face in this space need to address urgently or in the long term.
- Current opportunities
- Other people/organizations I should reach out to",,

```let me know your idea and if DAO is OK with it bring it in and going on...```
My goal is to help build all the channels you and others need to succeed! 🙌 

I'd recommend sharing your proposal additionally in: #project-guiding, #✨︱find-a-team-old, #🗳︱ocean-dao 
If you want to engage with others, the #🪢︱ambassadors are also full of knowledgeable people.

My recommendation is generally for people to collaborate. #✨︱find-a-team-old is undervalued. Feedback is only as good as the people contributing on the project. 
I recommend working with others in the community. 🤝 

If you want to apply, then I'd recommend submitting your proposal like you were before. 🗳️ 

```Does it have any limitations for countries?```
No, anyone is welcome to apply for a grant.",,

1. We are looking for technical/strategic support to explore adoption/implementation/grant-application of Ocean Protocol (or similar DAO) for our startup (developing the world's first personal safety barometer - just launched our Reg CF campaign):  https://wefunder.com/safe-esteem
2. We believe our business and mission represent the quintessential application of the DAO Economy and Compute-to-Data Architecture: We are creating (and have a patent for) a universal personal life risk scoring system (accidents, crime, health). Think of it as the FICO score of life risks - but owned by each individual (instead of credit rating firms) who can participate in the larger market/economy of brokers, insurers et al, while preserving privacy and allowing increasingly sophisticated risk (and safety) models. 
3. I just used an adapted version of the Ocean Compute-to-Data Architecture graph for remarks at the United Nations Climate and SDG Synergies Conference https://www.un.org/en/climate-sdgs-conference-2022/page/side-events (with very clear attribution) to highlight the opportunities of a DAO/NFT approach to risk data (I hope the Ocean folks won't be upset - it was a last opportunity - happy to coordinate on the next event.

if anyone has more detailed resources to share, i'd be grateful for anything. and if AI tutoring sounds like an interesting problem to you, let's chat about it!! i've been deep down the web3 rabbithole for the past ~2 years so i'm getting back up to speed with the recent advances in transformer-based models. i'd love to meet anyone who wants to jam on ideas around how this ml pipeline could work. thanks ✌️",,"❤️ (2),🙌 (2),🤩 (2)"

With regards to labeling and human-in-the-loop, it might be interesting to see how DataUnion structured their operational model.

Basically, users are rewarded for both sharing data, in addition to labeling it.

And as you pointed out, are rewarded as part of a union, owning shares of that DAO, rather than receiving a flat fee and being done.

I read the white paper and watched some videos but I fail to understand two things:

- if data is ""hidden"" behind a certain URL, how exactly is a ""client"" reading the data without getting aware of this URL? Or is he getting the URL? If so what hinders him to re-visit this URL at any time in the future? Will the URL stay hidden for ever? If so:  who is accessing the URL on behalf of the client?

- if I (as a ""client"") have bought a data token, what hinders the publisher to take down his data? This would make my bought data token worthless. Do clients simply have to trust that publishers do not take down assets? 

Would be great if you could provide some reference for clarification.",,

A use case is for example, a user creates a workspace and want to write a book with the support of a LLM lets say gpt 4, so he starts to explain  whats about and then he starts to mark the most suitable answer and save the outcome in his workspace.  The problem with common LLMs is that the context get lost if your token size is limited. therefore the system should keep the context intactand if the user asks lets say in chapter 22 about Kreig, the system should get the context and based on that the user can continue his progress...This is only a use case, but you can rely this pattern in different scenarios, for example code snippets from LLMs ai prompts to an entire project",,

To start learning about Ocean Protocol and its role in creating a decentralized data marketplace, you can follow these steps:

Understand Ocean Protocol's Mission and Core Technologies: Ocean Protocol aims to level the playing field for AI and data by enabling the monetization of AI models and data while preserving privacy. Its core technologies include Data NFTs & datatokens for token-gated access control and Compute-to-Data for buying and selling private data while preserving privacy.

Explore What You Can Do with Ocean: Depending on your interest or expertise, you can engage with Ocean Protocol in various capacities such as a builder, data scientist, or OCEAN holder. Each role offers different opportunities, from building token-gated AI dApps and APIs to earning rewards through data farming.

Join the Ocean Protocol Community: Becoming an Ocean ambassador is a great way to get involved. You can join Ocean Protocol's Discord server, participate in discussions, and apply to become an ambassador through the #treasure-hunter channel on Discord.

Learn Through Doing: Consider participating in data challenges hosted by Ocean Protocol to apply your skills in real-world problems and earn prizes.

Dive Deeper into Documentation: Visit the Developers and Data Scientists pages on Ocean Protocol's website for step-by-step instructions, APIs, libraries, and other tools to build dApps or integrate with the Ocean ecosystem.

Stay Informed: Keep up with the latest updates and resources by following Ocean Protocol's official channels and participating in community events.

I've been lurking for about a year, while the rest of my life slowed down. I am able to focus and I want to align myself with someone more experienced who might be interested or benefit from what I am doing.  

I am self directed, but having a stable point of communication helps things develop.  Even if it is an overly critical, difficult personality. (sigh)  So don't think you won't help. 

My ultimate goal is a data processing project, that will help prepare data for the Ocean Protocol (or whatever) for AI consumption. I have details and fun reasons. I have 25 years of on and off programming experience, but only shortly in SWD - 99% in Business or research (social network analysis) and large scale data engineering/DevOps problems. Lots of experience with data collection.  

I am looking to gather people around me who would like to talk about this project in more detail, but specifically, I want to gain the interest of an older student/teacher, who will be comfortable communicating consistently, and being my point of contact on this discord. 

If anyone would like assistance from me, I would like to help, but I know zero at this point. I am willing to write a 'how to guide' as I do this. 

This is Elvis entering the building. Sorry for the loud entry.",,

2. **Liquidity mining phase:** This phase began in August 2020 and will continue until 2024. During this phase, OCEAN tokens are distributed as liquidity mining rewards to users who provide liquidity to designated pools on decentralized exchanges.

3. **Staking and ecosystem grants phase:** This phase will begin after the liquidity mining phase ends in 2024. During this phase, OCEAN tokens will be distributed as staking rewards to users who stake their tokens to secure the network. Ecosystem grants will also be awarded to projects and individuals who contribute to the Ocean Protocol's development and growth.

Data NFTs are non-fungible tokens that represent a unique piece of data, such as a dataset or a data service. Each data NFT is unique and can be owned by a single entity at a time. Data NFTs can be traded on data marketplaces, allowing data providers to monetize their data assets.

Datatokens, on the other hand, are ERC20 tokens that represent a fractional ownership of a data NFT. They allow for the creation of a market for data, where data providers can sell fractional ownership of their data assets to multiple buyers. Datatokens can be traded on decentralized exchanges and used in DeFi applications.

In summary, data NFTs represent unique pieces of data, while datatokens represent fractional ownership of those data NFTs. Together, they enable the creation of data markets and the monetization of data assets.",,

One way to implement this is to create a form on the marketplace where users can input the parameters they want to pass to the compute-to-data job. Then, when the user submits the form, the marketplace can use the Ocean Protocol API to create a new compute-to-data job and pass the parameters as input to the job. Here's some sample code to get you started:

```
// Define the parameters that the user can input
const parameters = {
  param1: '',
  param2: '',
  param3: ''
};

// Create a form to collect the user's input
const form = document.createElement('form');
form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  // Get the user's input from the form
  const input1 = event.target.elements.param1.value;
  const input2 = event.target.elements.param2.value;
  const input3 = event.target.elements.param3.value;
  
  // Create a new compute-to-data job using the Ocean Protocol API
  const jobId = await ocean.compute.createComputeJob({
    input: {
      param1: input1,
      param2: input2,
      param3: input3
    }
  });
  
  // Redirect the user to the job details page
  window.location.href = `/jobs/${jobId}`;
});

// Add input fields to the form for each parameter
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(parameters)) {
  const input = document.createElement('input');
  input.type = 'text';
  input.name = key;
  input.placeholder = key;
  form.appendChild(input);
}

// Add the form to the marketplace page
document.body.appendChild(form);
```

This code creates a form with input fields for each parameter, and listens for the form to be submitted. When the form is submitted, it uses the Ocean Protocol API to create a new compute-to-data job with the user's input as the job input. Finally, it redirects the user to the job details page so they can monitor the job's progress.",,

On the other hand, a datatoken (ERC20) is used to access data services and represents a certain amount of access to a specific data asset. It contains information such as the amount of access it provides and the address of the data provider.

The more OCEAN tokens you lock or if you lock them for a longer period of time, the more rewards you can accumulate. Once you have veOCEAN tokens, you can allocate them to Ocean Market projects on the Data Farming page to earn weekly OCEAN rewards based on project sales. Rewards can be claimed every Thursday on the Rewards page.",,

This can be done using the `metadata` parameter when creating the NFT using ocean.js. 

For example, you can set the `metadata` parameter to include a `collection` field with the desired collection name:

```
const metadata = {
  name: ""My DataNFT"",
  description: ""This is my data NFT"",
  collection: ""My Collection""
};

const dataToken = await ocean.assets.create(

```
const ocean = await Ocean.getInstance({

  nodeUri: 'https://node.oceanprotocol.com',
  aquariusUri: 'https://aquarius.oceanprotocol.com',
  brizoUri: 'https://brizo.oceanprotocol.com',

const datatokenAddress = '0x123456789abcdef'; // replace with your datatoken address
const amount = 100; // replace with the amount of datatokens to buy

const buyDatatoken = async () => {
  const accounts = await ocean.accounts.list();
  const account = accounts[0];
  const datatoken = await ocean.datatokens.get(datatokenAddress);
  const tx = await datatoken.buy(amount, account);
  console.log(tx);
};

// call buyDatatoken() when the user clicks a button or performs some other action
```

This code assumes that the user has already connected their Metamask wallet to your website and has sufficient $OCEAN tokens to buy the datatokens. You'll need to replace the `datatokenAddress` variable with the address of the datatoken you want to buy, and the `amount` variable with the amount of datatokens to buy. You can also customize the `nodeUri`, `aquariusUri`, and `brizoUri` variables to point to your own Ocean Protocol nodes if you have them.

// Get the datatoken instance
const datatoken = await ocean.datatokens.get(dataTokenAddress)

// Remove the datatoken from the DataNFT
await dataNFT.removeDatatoken(datatoken)
```

In this example, we first initialize an instance of the Ocean object with the necessary parameters. Then, we get the instances of the DataNFT and datatoken using their respective addresses. Finally, we remove the datatoken from the DataNFT using the `removeDatatoken` method.

### IPFS

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a peer-to-peer protocol for sharing and storing hypermedia in a distributed file system. IPFS allows you to store and share files in a decentralized way, without relying on a central server.

**Step 1 - Install IPFS**

Install IPFS on your local machine by following the instructions on the [official IPFS website](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/).

**Step 2 - Add file to IPFS**

Add the file you wish to host to IPFS by running the following command in your terminal:

```
ipfs add <file>
```

This will return a CID (Content Identifier) for the file.

**Step 3 - Copy the CID**

Copy the CID from the output of the previous command.

![IPFS add file output](../.gitbook/assets/ipfs-1.png)

This CID will be used as the `CID` field when publishing the asset on Ocean Marketplace.

There are several ways to leverage the Ocean token to create increasing long-term value for it similar to Bitcoin:

1. Staking: Ocean token holders can stake their tokens to participate in the network and earn rewards. This incentivizes token holders to hold onto their tokens, which can increase demand and value over time.

2. Governance: Ocean token holders have voting rights in the governance of the network. This means that they can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, which can increase the utility and value of the token.

3. Data market fees: When data is bought and sold on the Ocean marketplace, a portion of the transaction fees are paid in Ocean tokens. As the usage of the marketplace grows, so does the demand for Ocean tokens, which can increase their value.

4. DeFi integrations: Ocean tokens can be integrated into various DeFi protocols, such as lending and borrowing platforms, which can increase their utility and demand.

Overall, the success of the Ocean protocol and the adoption of its marketplace will be key factors in determining the long-term value of the Ocean token. As more data providers and consumers use the marketplace, the demand for Ocean tokens is likely to increase, which can drive up their value over time.",,

The `swapExactAmountIn` function allows you to swap a specific amount of a token for an exact amount of Ocean tokens. On the other hand, the `swapExactAmountOut` function allows you to swap a specific amount of Ocean tokens for an exact amount of another token.

To use these functions, you will need to provide the smart contract with the necessary parameters such as the token addresses, the amount of tokens to swap, and the minimum/maximum amount of Ocean tokens to receive.

You can interact with the smart contract using a web3 provider such as MetaMask or by using a library such as ethers.js or web3.js.

Function: `swapExactAmountOut`

Parameters:
- `tokenIn`: The address of the input token to swap.
- `tokenAmountIn`: The amount of input tokens to swap.
- `tokenOut`: The address of the output token to receive.
- `minAmountOut`: The minimum amount of output tokens to receive.
- `maxPrice`: The maximum price to pay for the output tokens.

Returns:
- `amountOut`: The amount of output tokens received.

Example usage:
```solidity
// Assume we have the following variables defined:
// address poolAddress = address of the liquidity pool smart contract
// address tokenIn = address of the input token to swap
// uint256 tokenAmountIn = amount of input tokens to swap
// address tokenOut = address of the output token to receive
// uint256 minAmountOut = minimum amount of output tokens to receive
// uint256 maxPrice = maximum price to pay for the output tokens

IERC20(tokenIn).approve(poolAddress, tokenAmountIn);
uint256 amountOut = ILiquidityPool(poolAddress).swapExactAmountOut(
    tokenIn,
    tokenAmountIn,
    tokenOut,
    minAmountOut,
    maxPrice
);
```

In this example, we first approve the liquidity pool smart contract to spend the input tokens on our behalf. Then, we call the `swapExactAmountOut` function on the liquidity pool smart contract, passing in the necessary parameters. The function returns the amount of output tokens received, which we can then use as needed.",,

1. **Collect the necessary materials**: You will need 7 cobblestones, 1 bow, and 1 redstone dust to craft a dispenser. You can find cobblestones commonly by mining stone blocks, craft a bow using 3 sticks and 3 strings, and obtain redstone dust by mining redstone ore.

2. **Craft the dispenser**: Open your crafting table and place the 7 cobblestones in a U shape, the bow in the middle slot, and the redstone dust in the bottom middle slot. This will create a dispenser.

3. **Choose a location**: Decide where you want to place your dispenser. It can be on the ground, on a wall, or even facing downwards or upwards.

4. **Place the dispenser**: Select the dispenser in your hotbar and right-click on the surface where you want to place it. The dispenser's direction will be facing you when you place it.

5. **Load the dispenser**: Right-click on the dispenser to open its interface. You can place up to 9 different items in it, which it will dispense one at a time when activated.

6. **Activate the dispenser**: You can activate the dispenser by using redstone power. This can be a redstone torch, a block of redstone, a lever, a button, or any other redstone activation device. When the dispenser is powered, it will dispense one of the items inside.

Remember, the dispenser will shoot out most items as entities, but it will use certain items as if they were being used by a player (like arrows, eggs, or potions).",,

```javascript
import { Ocean, DataTokens } from '@oceanprotocol/lib'
```

2. Initialize the Ocean instance:

```javascript
const ocean = await Ocean.getInstance(config)

```javascript
const datatoken = new DataTokens(
  '0x123', // This is the address of the DataToken contract
  ocean.web3

Please replace '0x123' with the address of your DataToken contract. The second argument is the web3 instance from the Ocean object.

3. After that, you can create a dispenser:

```javascript
const dispenserAddress = await ocean.dispenser.createDispenser(datatoken, account)

4. Finally, you can approve and request datatokens:

```javascript
await ocean.dispenser.approve(datatoken, 100, account)
await ocean.dispenser.requestTokens(datatoken, 100, account)

Please note that you need to replace `'https://example.com'` with your own URL, and `100` with the amount of datatokens you want to approve and request. Also, make sure that the account you are using has enough balance to create and request datatokens.",,

If `createNftWithDatatokenWithDispenser` is returning null, it could mean that the function didn't execute correctly, possibly because the dispenser address passed was incorrect or not recognized.

Ensure that you're passing a valid Ethereum address that corresponds to a deployed and correctly functioning dispenser contract.

3. **Create a Fre Token**: Visit the Mintbase website and connect your NEAR wallet. Click on ""Mint a Thing"" and follow the instructions to create your Fre token.

4. **Create a Dispenser**: After creating your Fre token, go to the ""My Market"" section and click on ""Create Dispenser"". Set the price and amount of Fre tokens you want to dispense.

5. **Fund the Dispenser**: Click on ""Fund Dispenser"" and confirm the transaction in your NEAR wallet. The dispenser will now automatically sell your Fre tokens to anyone who sends the correct amount of NEAR tokens to it.

Remember, this is a simplified guide. The actual process may involve more steps and require a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and the NEAR Protocol. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from professionals or experienced users.",,
