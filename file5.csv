"". and the info there is simply executing on a policy that we've communicated since the earliest days of ocean. ""   never heard that before. any source that says team were minting all tokens?   from the article: ""this (minting the rest of the supply) will make it un-pausable  and fully decentralized & censorship-resistant.""  how? these are just buzzwords with no explanation... how is that 7 anonymous people controlling 56%+ of the supply is unpausable  censorship resistant  or decentralised? (not to mention the other ~30% under binance's control)  this whole process seems so suspicious to me and the inadequate explanation even more so. completely dejected from this project and disappointed how communication with the community has been neglected.",,,

(can we have the addresses of these wallets?) a new 'un-pausable' contract has been created to vest the tokens as community rewards through df. **why have the team done this? what problem did this remedy?** **how is this 'fully decentralised'? how is this 'censorship resistant'? **  now we have to __trust__ these 7 entities  (who will remain anonymous i assume) to carry out the same tokenomics for decades.  the tokenomics have been altered at least 2 times in the last 2 years.  what's the github link you sent? is this the current contract working on the new multi-sig wallets or the old contract?,,,

2023-07-19 16:47:00,,white_rider_,843831770062913500,Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],hello @databites.eth  let me try to respond to your questions:  option 1 - if you choose to publish a dataset as downloadable  interested buyers can acquire datatokens to gain access to it. the data provider ensures privacy by encrypting the source details such as the url or ipfs id. however  buyers can download the data. when users purchase access through datatokens  they essentially obtain a license to use the data for a specific purpose set by the data provider and enforced by smart contracts. nevertheless  tracking and monitoring if they share or use the data differently from its intended purpose can be challenging due to the decentralized nature of the system.  option 2 - anyone can develop algorithms to process your dataset. to facilitate this  it's crucial to include sufficient information in the dataset documentation  allowing users to understand its structure without directly accessing the raw data. best practices involve providing a sample file that demonstrates the data's format. however  to prevent potential data theft or misuse  the data publisher must approve algorithms before they are allowed to run on the dataset. this approval process helps ensure that only trustworthy and non-malicious algorithms can access and process the data  safeguarding its integrity and security.   i hope this clears up any confusion you may have.,,,
