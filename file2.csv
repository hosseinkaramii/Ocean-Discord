The testing is a one time effort of ~45mins. It involves reviewing a design mockup of a custom Ocean powered marketplace and providing feedback on the basic naming, theme, colors, navigation etc. As a token of recognition, each tester will get about 15 OCEAN Token. 
 
Who @here would like to take part? Sheridan, who came with the request, is looking to find interested ambassadors by this Friday March 5th.",,

I’m excited to join and discover how I can best use my skillset to help build on Ocean’s vision. I work in Product Development/Management and recently negotiated and implemented a $6.5m USD development contract with over 40 developers and designers. 

I’m eager to build products and am open to submitting a proposal for review but don’t yet have a strong use case. I’ve been speaking with @Mark about the positioning/business strategy with Ocean and keen to explore this topic in more detail. We collaborated on a question for the community below:",,

As we understand, the Ocean protocol is ultimately a 2 sided marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of data. One could have a popular dataset on an Ocean Market which generates $500,000 in revenue and another person may have 500 datasets on Ocean Market generating $0 in revenue based on the demand for their data assets. 

It’s possible (but unlikely) that I am going to receive a lot of money for sharing my personal location data. Even in the best case scenario I may generate a few $100 dollars which some may find attractive but most will encounter too much friction/hesitation towards opening up and sharing their personal data for some relatively small sum of money. (This may not be the case in all situations/countries as a few hundred dollars will be a lot of money but in those cases the buying power of that consumer base would be lower and therefore the incentive for businesses to leverage that data would be lower also).",,👍 (1)

    1.    Benefit from being used in machine learning algorithms, AI etc to create value (i.e. there is demand for the data).  
    2.    Be sold to the market without the company receiving a significant backlash from existing customers/business partners/shareholders i.e. the benefits of enabling access to the data (revenues generated) outweigh the costs of providing secure access to the data for the market to consume. One could imagine a backlash against a local retailer if customers discovered that all of a sudden their shopping data was being sold by the retailer for profit. 
This is where we start to get a little stuck… If there is huge revenue potential sitting behind closed doors (in privately held databases), then why wouldn’t a more traditional private company have come along and given the owners of these datasets the ability to compute against the datasets privately? Is this the secret sauce that’s only enabled through Ocean Protocol?

If not, then is it the open, networked and decentralised nature of the Ocean Protocol? Under this assumption we are assuming that an open, networked and decentralised org structure is the superior org structure for executing on this opportunity. 

It would be great to better understand this topic so that we can more accurately convey the USP to the market. Knowing the answer to this should also help indicate where to start looking for new business opportunities with Ocean.",,👍 (1)

This expands Ocean from being a two sided market to much more. The stakers become a part of the market as well. They curate, price and validate datasets but also benefit from that.

The combination of these features makes Ocean a 🦄.

Hi Scott! These are super valuable thoughts. Thanks for sharing!
The answer includes my personal perspective, there is potentially a lot more, but this is what is important in my opinion:

With compute-to-data you can sell data access without having the problems you mentioned. If set up correctly, there is no “backslash” from customers/business partners/shareholders because the data is never moved, data consumers never see the data itself.

Still, you (and any buyer) can generate insights on private data in a fully compliant way. This includes machine learning, business analytics, or other forms of data aggregation. It’s not about the data owner who can compute here. It’s about any potential buyer. And because Ocean is permissionless, this could be anyone.

As you say, this is a risk/reward trade-off. And the more sensitive the data, the more security you need to balance the risk. 

Data monetization makes sense for traditional companies in many cases, even when companies compete. MOBI is an example where traditional automakers can potentially share datasets for autonomous driving (without giving away the data) to compete with Tesla. In other cases, data can be a “byproduct” of a companies core business. In this case, it’s only a cost-center and they could start monetizing it. Compared to what is on the market right now, C2D is more about huge and valuable datasets. There are many similar examples we could think of.

“Turn your data storage into a profit center” (while keeping ownership and full control and being compliant) is one of the opportunities here.",,"✅ (2),👍 (2),🔥 (2)"

The pricing mechanism is definitely an interesting feature and one where the incentives that exist would probably be harder to replicate in a private model (in my head I keep comparing this to a private venture, not to discredit the Ocean project but to instead uncover the unique benefits of OP). Staking tokens on datasets encourages market participants to curate good data and send a signal to the market that ‘this is good data’ which is great. 

Open and permissionless access to data for C2D applications to run on is also another great benefit. Assuming this means that some people (with good intentions!) are accessing datasets they couldn’t otherwise access through other third party providers already. 

Data unions and shared data initiatives (like scanning bills and monetising as a group) is also a unique and interesting concept. In theory I could probably start something like that today (as a private venture) but be subject to a number of local laws and regulations (friction) and so doing something like this on OP where the incentives are closer to the consumer than they maybe are in a private model could be a unique benefit.",,

In other words it can only spread its incentives so thinly before it runs out. 

OP (and other decentralised projects for that matter) are more organic and take on a life of their own. As they are open and permissionless, anyone can jump on board, have a go, at no cost to the overarching entity (OP) i.e, not many people are spending their spare time thinking up new ways for Jeff Bezos to grow his empire - he has to employ people to do that for him. 

Therefore, those that jump on board and build things the market wants are rewarded and those that don’t, simply try again or fade away. The equivalent would be trying to convince a bunch of investors to invest in a private company where we will pay anyone who walks in through the door to do stuff and some will succeed and others will fail but we don’t really know what’s going to happen. 😆 

I feel like I’ve either gone on a complete tangent or am touching on something fundamentally important?",,

We hope you'll join us for the AMA with Matthias Kretschmann on Thursday 🙃 If you can, we'd love it if you could promote it within your own networks – esp. to solicit questions, which can be submitted on our Discord, Telegram, and Twitter by simply responding to the AMA announcement.

Matthias has been with ascribe, BigchainDB and Ocean for a long time, and knows Ocean Market inside out. Got a question about Ocean Market? How to get started with publishing datasets or algorithms? Curious about design for Web3 & dApps? Matthias has all of these covered.

Thank you!

Currently Director of Engineering at OLX Group (https://www.olxgroup.com/), technical background, but focused now on business/management areas - so I would like to contribute to the outreach ship (more about my experience here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/szymanskilukasz/)

I am also contributing to some blockchain-related projects as an advisor, and have strong network of blockchain-related creators, advocates, investors in Poland. 

I am fascinated by the Ocean Protocol, and I will try to contribute by building awareness/community in Poland and establishing some relationships/partnerships with companies.

Feels very rational and definitely something I’ll think about, as I do value the Ambassador program and all of you here!

Some thoughts.
- All future discussion in Data Whale videos will be circulating around market capitalization (not price).
- Video Caption & Thumbnail will still be heavily geared towards intensive clickbait, which may include references to price. However, price will not be explicitly discussed in the video itself, content is focused to be educational, though “sensational”.
- We’re not removing any past content.

What do you think?",,

1️⃣  Keep the policy as described in the pledge, no talk about the price of the Ocean token by Ambassadors, this is in line with the Ocean Protocol Foundation rule: Ambassadors ask themselves ""Would an OPF team member do this?"" before acting.
2️⃣  Change the policy to allow price talk and adapt the pledge accordingly. This allows Ambassadors to more actively promote the project in any way they see fit.

The poll will be open until Wednesday 8th of November 2021 at 4pm CEST, please only cast one vote.",,"1️⃣ (7),2️⃣ (3)"

I'm basically a Clinical doctor who switched to building stuff products in MedTech ranging from Biomedical engineering to Clinical data-science & AI. So it's been a great revelation for me to learn about Ocean-protocol where AI meets Blockchain.

I wanna say I wish to be involved in both technical and outreach 😅 . I'm more of a Project manager kind of guy who is trained to be a code whisperer of sorts, so i can work with people who code, and i try my hand in scaling any initiative with the relevant outreach from a business perspective/engaging with people, speaking the language of amazing people who are involved in Technology products.

As some of you may know I will have limited capacity to lead the Ocean Ambassador program over the next few weeks for personal reasons. During that time, the critical activities I was involved in will be covered by fellow senior Ambassadors. 

- @zippy1979 will take care of budget and finances. This process should move to Activity Farming and be managed as a team as early as February. In the meantime, Upkar will be in charge of validating with Ambassadors that they have completed their work, and preparing the list of payouts in OCEAN to Ambassadors.  

Upkar will also be the interim Program Lead, dealing with program improvements, being the liaison with the rest of the ecosystem, managing weekly updates in the OceanDAO meeting (this should be taken in turns by different ambassadors), and ensuring things run smoothly overall.

- @Andrea | Ocean Protocol will be the Community & Activity Lead, managing our group, the onboarding of new ambassadors and managing/coordinating the work of Ambassadors to ensure quality and timely deliveries.

- @Robin | DataUnion will prepare the Grant Proposal for OceanDAO R14, and keep co-approving transactions with me from our Gnosis safe.

Responsibilities and work in different WGs should be unaffected. I may have more time to allocate to the program than I anticipate, but I prefer to plan for the worst case and ensure that we have the right level of support for the group at all time.",,🤝 (4)

They've helped get ambassadors' priorities straight; we shall: 
- Recruit new active members in OceanDAO (projects, voters, WG contributors), with local and targeted events
- Keep relaying partnership and other announcements from OPF, as well as support the creation of communication at a conceptual level (+ create specific artefacts based on the concepts developed to be used for outreach)
- There could be some budget for a campaign, e.g. video, specifically targeting ambassadors to grow the group and keep driving the visibility for the big announcements to come
- There will be a new WG set-up specifically for outreach, and we will join, together with the local programs. This is going to be where the latest news are shared, and wider coordination re communication will take place. It's exciting!

Besides, there are awesome things in the pipeline!

https://indian-ocean.gitbook.io/indian-ocean-outreach-program/

This essentially covers the roadmap and activities that we have set out to complete by end of this month.

Would be nice to have some feedback before I accelerate on a few promo activities. We have also placed a program in the name of 'Indian Ocean' ambassadors, who also have to complete the Ocean Academy. The aim is to have a lot of funneling outreach through the ambassadors from now on. We were glad to onboard @Gyan | Starknet Foundation/TPG as one of our first Ambassadors through both Academy as well as through the google form that we have mentioned in the Gitbook.

On a high-level, expecting some feedback on

- Overall information flow - is it sufficient? Giving a good intel of what's been played out so far?
- How the specific Ambassador program google form looks in line with Ocean 101 activities?
- We have not really decided on any promo-based activities yet for Indian ambassadors, but we will be sourcing it completely from the budget reserved for us during the R10 budget.

- Any other feedback that can help us?

**On a parallel note:** We are also working on a few workshop initiatives that will help folks convert better for the Ocean academy that is often regarded as 'too heavy' for complete beginners. We intend to follow the process, but would be happy to receive some feedback on all the above. In the future we also plan to work on some materials that will help people understand the Ocean academy better. The following article is an example of that.

 We can also decide what should be in the academy and what would be best done outside of it.

Ocean 101 was designed (I did not participate here) very carefully with the specific intent to bring people from 0 to a minimum understanding of OP. This to me is the base minimum one requires to work/integrate and keep up with the conversations and iterations of OPF. If one cannot readily grasp this, 101, I'm along the lines that they should keep working at it until it makes sense. I really cannot see this as 'too heavy' and think if people find it so, perhaps Ocean Protocol is not for them.  Are you trying to educate people or help them pass for certification, perhaps that is what I do not understand?",,

While I'm on the same ethos that you had put forth. I'm merely echoing a few sentiments that I had received during my recent interactions with the community who expressed interest with both Ambassador group/ the Indian outreach which has a few subjective process as well but all are welcome to stay on our socials. They wanted better help in going through the academy with some handholding, which we are motivated to provide in our best capacity. 

While we wish to increase the ambassadors organically , some might take their own time before coming around to completing the academy. The aim of the Indian outreach is to also help the interested people to complete the academy as an Ambassador, not for passing it off as a certification from the Protocol.

Finally valid point taken from @LRT , will ensure that the the onboarding doesn't really clutter with @Andrea | Ocean Protocol 's process. We can have updates to any article that is being published about Ocean academy now/future in line with any changes made to the contents/website.",,

Re recruitment, here is how i view things overall:
- if we are talking about ocean ambassadors, then you should leverage the process @Andrea | Ocean Protocol is finalizing. There is a reason why ocean101 and the pledge have been set as requirements. We want the ambassadors to hold to the highest standards in quality and ethics.
- If we are talking about members of a network of ocean stakeholders for India, you can do whatever you want; you may fork anything that we did, it's all open source and shared with the community for that purpose.

I'll dive into the doc later anyways so i can have more precise feedback as well.",,👍 (1)

- As admittedly it's in a feedback phase at the moment and if there are any red-flags, would be happy to address it before venturing into any promos/activities (that we are deciding in line with a Final hackathon that is planned towards the end of Jan)

- In it's current format. We are trying to get them through the Google form, so the CTA leads them to relevant channels with questions resolved through us. Think of us as more of a guides/helping hands than any sort of gatekeepers/a deciding authority as far as the Main Ambassador WG is concerned. So this would not interfere with @Andrea | Ocean Protocol responsibilities at the moment.

Folks who remain committed to just the Indian outreach would remain on our socials.

- We may have an increase in the number of ambassadors coming from the Indian community and the aim is to have a CTA that bring them here, either 

A) Directly to the WG channel
B) Also get the relatively live support through Our Telegram/Discord channels that we have provided on our Linktree having the Socials 

- In terms of insights, it is still an open sentiment; that I had also gathered from @Gyan | Starknet Foundation/TPG who completed the Academy successfully, who believes in the program and has suggestions to improve it so we can have motivated members as Ambassadors while complying with the pledge. So this was not an insight that was completely based on folks who have not looked to commit to the Ambassadorship, yet. I hope that clarifies.",,

Quick update to keep you in the loop! 🚀 

As most of you may have realised from the ambassadors telegram group Q4/2021 saw a lot of planning and strategising. The vision of the Ambassador Program is to build an impactful global team that supports the growth of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem worldwide and, in order to achieve this, the Program needs to be well structured to welcome dozens, if not hundreds, of new ambassadors from each part of the world.
Ambassadors are now working hard to complete their tasks on time. The new program will be ready by end of this month and today we're sharing what will be its core: a brand new **Activity Farming and Rewards System.** 


**Activity Farming**. This is a list of activities that you as an ambassador can pick from and start working on anytime. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-nG2Vjvicg_a3CUK9FPh2queAOYzhRwNYZyhvOuU4M/edit?usp=sharing
Once you find the activity you like and you are ready to start, add a Trello card with the name of the activity under the “Active” column. 


- **Rewards System**. We have introduced a mix of basic rewards and performance rewards to promote fairness, transparency, and to incentivise high-quality works. 
Base rewards are distributed at the end of each month upon meeting the minimum requirements, whilst Performance Rewards will be distributed upon meeting the predetermined targets at the end of the relevant period. 

NOTE:  If you would like to propose an initiative not present in the Activity Farming list, please add a Trello card in the “Activities Awaiting Confirmation” column and share details such as objectives, rewards request, ETA. Your initiative will then be evaluated by the AP team. 

The Activity Farming list is a living document, it will be reviewed monthly and improved as the program grows. We always welcome suggestions, so please share feedback by adding your comments in the Google Docs.

Happy farming! 🧑‍🌾 ❤️",,"🥳 (6),🤩 (2),🥰 (1),🧜‍♀️ (1)"

1)    The Gitbook was a great idea, and it looks awesome. The Indian program is delivering on its objectives, which is excellent for everyone in the ecosystem!
2)    Handling ambassador recruitment through the Gitbook makes sense to build a vibrant Indian community, but it is not appropriate to recruit “Ocean Ambassadors” in my opinion. Why do I say that? 
a.    Because the Ocean Ambassadors have nearly completed a revamp of the onboarding process, and once the Ambassador website will be up, the Gitbook will be redundant. I would personally avoid duplicating processes/adding complexity and potential confusion for new ambassadors. 
b.    And because if we use the same process to recruit new members for different groups, we may end up facing unnecessary and unwishful competition across ‘branches’ of the program. 
c.    Finally, it could make sense to consider regional programs as standalone programs, that are not affiliated with the general ambassador group. All would meet and interact in a new Outreach WG, which I understand is in the process of being created. That’d be a great way to federate, share best practices and content, and loosely coordinate across all country programs, including Japan, Turkey, Greece, Nigeria, India, ..etc.",,👍 (1)

1 & 2) Will go through with the feedback with some more considerations. I will also convey them to @Andrea | Ocean Protocol , I had a call earlier today where I expressed that the Ambassador 'program' per se will be an effective add-on with funneling mechanisms & remove duplicity, with more focus on managing traffic henceforth. I will work on your feedback and pass onto Andrea as well so it's in line with the revamped process. 

**But** I see why you mention that they need not be recruited. I will see if the Google form can be sunset with a different mechanism in place, adding redundant process can affect the UX of the general program. Rebranding it slightly different will be helpful in context of Outreach.

c) The outreach WG makes sense, will be a great place to have the processes separate from the Ambassador program in general.

3) Thanks for the feedback. Workshops will be planned in tandem with feedback on the process of V2 version of the academy as well. I will check the updated flow before discussing this again while planning the academy.",,

Say for instance this month you complete the medium article, but not the telegram group. You may want to get paid for the article, but have no way to move that activity in the “Ready” column. 

That’s why, if you create one card per activity you can divide your work in micro tasks and ease your organization. But this is only a suggestion, feel free to keep it this way too! 🚀",,

We are feeling extremely happy to see lot of work coming to fruition. In fact, I am proud to finally announce the official revamp of the Ocean Protocol Ambassador Program (OPAP) 🚀 

Q4/2021 and beginning of Q1/2022 has seen a lot of planning, strategising and executing from every single ambassadors. The vision of the Ambassador Program is to build an impactful global team, that supports the growth of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem worldwide and, in order to achieve this, the Program needs to be well structured to welcome dozens, if not hundreds, of new ambassadors from each part of the world. This may, in the future, also involve having regional communities operating under the OPAP umbrella. 

Keeping our vision and needs in mind, the new program restructuring is now complete. I want to thank all Ambassadors and Ocean Core Team for their commitment to the program. Particularly I want to personally thank @LRT, @Robin | DataUnion , @blockchainlugano and @zippy1979 for supporting us in making this possible. 

Today I'm excited to announce:

- A revamped workspace to allow better coordination amongst ambassadors. The workspace is hosted on Notion, a tool that promotes team work and transparency. More details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/Welcome-Aboard-cc9dbe2acbf44908aa7e8aa712a2b9f9

- A revamped onboarding process, where candidates will be guided through the ambassador website (Work in progress: http://oceanambassadors.community) -> Ocean 101 -> and eventually invited to an onboarding video call scheduled each week.

- The introduction of ""Activity Farming"". A smooth and efficient process for each ambassador to actively contribute to preapproved activities supporting OPF, and get rewarded based on two criteria: The deliverable itself & Performance. More details here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-nG2Vjvicg_a3CUK9FPh2queAOYzhRwNYZyhvOuU4M/edit?usp=sharing

- An experimental reputation system that helps to promote engagement, increased contributions and team working within the OPAP. This system allows ambassadors to earn XP based on their contribution to the program - helping them stand out in our new Ambassador Leaderboard. More details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/Leaderboard-f24b2461b60f4ce1970b255f7dd8767f

- OceanAcropolis. An open space for each ambassador to showcase their work, giving them (and everyone else) visibility across social media channels such as Twitter. More details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/OceanAcropolis-750c110a7a234a7e86f577e7431f573c

- A revised Reward System to promote fairness, transparency, and to incentivise high-quality work. We have introduced a mix of basic rewards and performance rewards. Again, more details here: https://oceanambassadors.notion.site/OCEAN-Rewards-e803515ecda54c1f8fa5200af0343d40

- An open calendar where to find all OPAP meetings. As agreed with @Idiom | Ocean Protocol, all future Ambassadors meetings going forward will be publicly held in the #Ambassadors WG. More details here: https://www.notion.so/oceanambassadors/ff179fec09014037b29ac1bce067080a?v=47d781c17e0e426cafc48623f9398688

- An awesome video for everyone to quickly learn about Ocean Protocol and familiarise with the data economy. Sneak peek coming asap. 

Last but not least, we have also been working on our first AmbassadorDAO. However, this is still work in progress and shan’t reveal more at this time 🤐 

Plenty more is in the pipeline, and we're all looking forward to seeing what 2022 has for us!

This looks like a lot of marketing for me.

I also do not at all understand why a project that a co-founder of Ocean invested in makes it into the Ocean Protocol news stream.
There is no endorsement of Ocean Protocol and Ocean also does not appear anywhere in their whitepaper or technical specs.

Starting off with a general funda (feel free to critique).  For a p2e concept to work on the current concept, and to interface with a convenient Crypto-network component it has to be with a chain that doesn't disturb the end-user in anyway right?

So essentially that has to function with a network that is conducive for faster txns and lower fee, so from my birds eye view I see that Polygon, Solana are really popular on that front ~ which has happened as a result of marketing of course. Might be a reason why we have so many p2e games from a few suspect chains as a function of marketing/ecosystem push.

Do you have any line of thoughts to this @Robin | DataUnion on what you're developing?",,

I believe they overstate ""consensus"" which relates to day-to-day operations and understate ""strategic governance"" which relates to deep gov redesign, vision or objective changes of the systems when needed. 

The Gitcoin presentation is fascinating. I wish someone old these guys that data should be expressed in % terms rather than absolute number of survey respondents.. but it doesn't change the value of the insights gathered. Brilliant. I think we can relate to this comment re pain points ""The biggest pain point are people who want to help but need to be helped to be able to help 🙂 So, for now only very assertive people find something to do.""",,

I.e. over the weekend was the Soverign Nature Init. hackathon and many were using it due to Ocean's grant, but i imagine there are others out there building projects off Ocean. this is of course a two way street but may be a way to bring the OPF DAO in front of more participants.

I can imagine many don't know about the existence of OceanDAO and this knowledge might bring them to build, or support Ocean and vote.

I do think the ambassador medium should be better curated indeed.

- centralisazion of articles into the OPAP medium account (with no audience and exposure yet) 

- publishing articles on ambassadors’ medium account leveraging on their audience/community.

While I prefer the first approach as it can be seen as a more long term strategy, it won’t really bring many benefits to Ocean Protocol in the short term (particularly V4). The second approach doesn’t bring any benefits to OPAP but it does help OPF getting more exposure. 

Hence the question, is there a way you see both solutions coexisting or are they mutually exclusive? Happy to hear other ambassadors too

1) Double dipping => Not encouraged. Completely agree ✅

3) How the Acropolis functions is your discretion indeed. I don't have any confusion here.

I’m wondering whether you could also attach a document outlining the agenda and outcomes of the event, maybe some amateur videos taken during the event and the list of participants with their personal information (for those that accepted to share them) ? I think it’d be great to follow up with them and invite them over to our discord

I’m also planning to organise a couple of events here in London, in partnership with Imperial College and Santander. And I’m thinking that the more insights we can gather about events organised WW the better future ones can be organised",,"👍 (5),🇺🇬 (1)"

2) @Mucu did not qualify for the Base nor Performance reward for the physical event as per my notes from the Notion submission. However the event did qualify for the March version of the $200 reward level, so this will be paid. We have however not had any follow on results from these meet ups, 0 Ambassador applications, 0 project onboardings, 0 contributors, so @Mucu , no more events until we can agree on what the value is for the Ambassadors and Ocean Protocol. I will reach out and help you come up with an agenda/goal that you can work towards for further physical meetings, if that is what you want to try to arrange.",,👍 (7)

At the moment its 30$ Base reward for articles > 500 words and 1000$ Base reward for articles > 1000 words. 

The problem is : The most interesting and relevant articles from OP are mainly above 1500 - 2000 words. But at the moment the work/reward ratio for articles slightly above 1000 words is the best. So the motivation to translate that kind of articles instead of the ones that are much more interesting & relevant is much higher. By raising the reward for this the motivation to translate that articles will rise. 

I suggest adding 3 categories according to the work load: 

> 1500 words = 150 USD Base Rewards + 450 USD Bonus Rewards for 1k Impressions within 3 Month
> 2000 words = 200 USD Base Rewards + 600 USD Bonus Rewards for 1k Impressions within 3 Month
> 2500 words = 250 USD Base Rewards + 750 USD Bonus Rewards for 1k Impressions within 3 Month",,👍 (7)

I think it's more than appropriate to strip off the last remaining TradBiz / enterprise ties (this is aligned with Trent) and remove the ""Sie"" and replace it with a ""Du"" in our German translations. 

Context for non-German speakers: 
""Sie"" is close to the old English word ""thee"", a (very) polite way of addressing the reader, while ""Du"" is close to the English ""You"". 

It reads and looks intuitive, compared to all stuff I read on Blockchain and Web3.

- With the /Poll Command you can easily create polls. Normal polls have no time limit. A poll can be either a simple yes/no poll or a poll with up to 20 custom answers. When you create a Poll, you can choose who is allowed to vote

- With the /TimePoll Command you can easily create polls with time limit. In this case a poll can run for a maximum of 7 days.

**Useful commands to use: **

allowedrole - to restrict voting to certain roles 
text - to add a long description, perhaps to give context and introduce the reason of the poll
time - to set a time limit to the poll

**Note:**

- You can only create a poll if you're an admin, or have been given the PollCreator role
- To create polls in private channels, go to channel -> permissions -> add role -> EasyPoll",,🔥 (2)

For those who recently joined, this monthly one-hour meeting will be an informal conversation aimed at sharing feedback to improve and grow OPAP. Also, as V4 is approaching, we want to make sure we align our work as much as possible with OPF's objectives in order to support them the best way possible. The TownHall will serve for this purpose too. 

You're all invited to join the meeting here on Discord on May 4th, at 4PM UTC - right after the OceanDAO TownHall. It's an open meeting, so the more the merrier 🙂

With V4 launching soon, this could be the opportunity to consider a Discord revamp with a bit more branding and fresher structure? @Idiom | Ocean Protocol @Wally @Casiana ~ Ocean Protocol Not sure who to ping right now, my apologies for the spamming. Thoughts?",,

I also want to be mindful about not spamming our Discord, but I think a Channel with ""Official Links"" would be helpful in the ""Welcome to Ocean"" section. 

I tend to replace ""gm"" with it. It is used, but not as much. And everyone saying gm in the ocean-dao channel instead could even boost collabo. 

So let me ask you guys a favor:

Compile a comprehensive (all essentials there, not too spammy first post) list ""Official Links"" right here (can/should include truly official links like oceanprotocol.com, but also Academy, Ambassadors, etc.).

In short: Going through those 5-10 Links will tell you everything you need to know about Ocean in under 15minutes.

Post the List here, let's elaborate/collect views, and I will create the channel. 

Thx for raising it, Andrea! ☯️🙌",,👍 (1)

For sure, we're currently trying to understand whether having an official-link channel makes sense to gather the most important information about OP or if it's just another method to organise information that doesn't contribute towards awareness and better communication.

Activity Farming Review meeting was meant to be happening today at 6pm CET but due to some overlapping with other core meetings we’d like to move it to 5pm CET. Hence in around 2 hours from now. 

The meeting will continue until 6.30pm so hopefully everyone will still have a chance to join and listen in.

Looking forward to seeing many of you here later 🚀",,

Only point on attribution: it makes a lot of sense that Nicolas and Jesus you get recognition as the authors of the e-book, but it should be integrated differently IMO, perhaps even with a page dedicated to ""the eBook authors"". Regarding the attribution of content on p2, it should be provided by Ocean Academy DAO LTd. Pte.

We are about to do the disbursements for April deliveries, which when completed, will deplete the treasury. We have submitted a funding proposal for OceanDAO R17. However until new funds are disbursed from the DAO we will not be able to pay the bounties for activities that people may deliver.
**I would ask for your patience and need to request that activities be paused for May until we have confirmation of funding.**
You may ask why we are in this situation, the answer is simple. A combination of the recent market drop affecting the value of the mOCEAN we hold, as well as many of the team overdelivering (and reaching performance targets) in April means that we have needed to pay out more than usual.",,

Hello OPAP Friends 

The OceanDAO reconcilliation is now complete and we did not make the funding this round despite attracting more than 1.3m votes. This again means that we will need to pause the Activity Farming until we can resolve the funding issue. I personally will not be drawing any rewards, until this issue is resolved. Everything else needs to be paused (other than Twitter which we need to maintain for visibility and growth). For the activities already submitted we will review them in the month end Activity Farming Review as usual, however how the treasury will be dispersed, will need to be voted on by the members of OPAP. I will ask that when you cast your votes you consider the long term health of the program rather than short term personal gains.

I am in discussions with our advisors how best to handle this situation going forward, applying for funds in every single OceanDAO funding round rather than once per quarter, is not a sustainable funding model for an Ambassadors program. We will need to make changes no matter what.

How we address this and create a sustainable funding model will be worked on and shared with you for comment and then pushed forward. Anyone who wishes to help with this process is welcome to reach out to myself or @blockchainlugano  and your input will be appreciated.",,"❤️ (11),🤝 (8),🙏 (8)"

💥  If you have not written before I highly recommend submitting a sample to us before tackling this.

✅ Some of us have already spoken and I am happy for you to go ahead and tackle a blog post. 

📌 Reminder, all blogs will go through a draft review. 

🫂 We are a big team and truly support one another. That being said, there are deadlines and quality standards, and if we feel the blog is not quite publishable, we will likely reassign it to another writer.

🤝 Your notes (we recommend using Google Docs) are important to us as well as OPF so they *must* be posted in Discord

👀  You will contact the funded DAO projects using the provided contact details from the DAO applications; you **must** CC op_ambassadors@protonmail.com in **all** correspondence with subjects.

📌  Today we had our inaugural **Ocean Community Jam** sesh and ironed out some deets regarding format and objectives.

🤝 Part of being an *active* Ambassador is remaining up to date on what's happening in the Ocean ecosystem and how things work. We would appreciate it if you attend them as it's a great way to get answers to questions you may have as well as participate in ideating within community. **Everyone** is welcome to talk.

🚨 Currently we are setting these at different times on Thursday to gauge the best hour to set this at in the future, check the official OPF calendar for upcoming details.

🙏 See you soon and feel free to invite your non-ambassador friends to this event, it really is for everyone.",,"✅ (6),❤️ (6)"

To clarify writing about the OceanDAO blogs. 

1) OP Ambassador email MUST be cc'd in ALL correspondence with DAO grantee in order to have proof of their responses and verify context and writing within the draft that can then be used for the final product. We have received sparse to no communication nor answers in this delivery chain.

2) The blog post is attributed to the writer or the Ambassadors, this is the writers choice. HOWEVER, seeing as this is a remunerated activity, OPF needs to have first publishing rights to this and I kindly ask Ambassadors'
--- to NOT publish their blog posts BEFORE OPF
--- to wait until the draft has been verified and edited, and is good for publication. 

3) Again, if you have questions as to how this works please reach out to me or @zippy1979 .

👀 As many of you may have seen, yesterday a tweet dropped from rep3.gg. 
What is it you ask? Well, head to their site to check out how they have whipped up an awesome system to credential community members participation.

📌 If you are an Ocean Ambassador in **2022** and are not actively participating, that does not disqualify you from gaining a membership badge. These are for ALL ambassadors. In this case please DM me your addy so that I may mint a badge for you in the event your address is not on the Notion page of wallets.

I understand the concept. The story is interestingly told. Maybe the comic will be interesting? There is a lot of action. One question. Why is the main character's name Volodymyr?  

If you create a text and publish it at a certain time and under certain circumstances. Readers will always have connotations of what is happening around them. I suggest choosing a more neutral name for these times. So that readers can fully focus on your story without context. Contexts create metaphors.",,

I see now that giving the main character the same first name as the Ukrainian president may not have been amusing and proved a distraction. So I’ve changed the name. But I haven’t used Alice or Bob. Here’s the thinking.

That Wikipedia article was illuminating. I wasn’t thrilled with Alice or Bob because they have personalities. Now I’ve learned that their personalities were defined in an ""After Dinner Speech"" in 1984. The main character of our User Story doesn’t fit those personalities. He’s a developer type.

Since those early days more characters have been added to the Alice & Bob story. There’s Eve, who’s an eavesdropper, and Mallory, who’s malicious. There’s also “Ivan The Honourable” who was invented in 2002.

'Ivan' is a fitting name for a dev. It connotes the right mindset. Someone who’s honourable and concerned about the quality of the code. The name is also not tied to any specific country. Could even be American, like Alice & Bob are.

Thus the main character in our User Story is now Ivan, and I think it’s a real improvement. Thanks for your feedback, it proved valuable. 🙏",,"👌 (1),👍🏻 (1)"

Your continued participation in OPAP is untenable. Your behaviour meets neither the professional nor ethical standards required within the program. We can go into fine details via DM, feel free to reach out.

We don't need your consent to do this.

As you are well aware, since I shared my chaser email from Friday with you, it has been followed up with the owner within OPF. I have not had a reply as yet about it, and will chase again later this week. If you want to follow this up again, reach out via DM.",,

I could def see Sebastian making this a proposal for the last DAO round (for now), but I'm also in heavy support of having this kind of data on Ocean Market in general, if no grant would be won (Gonna be a tough competition in this last round.) Very important field of ""data"", looking at the global impact of good journalism. 

Let me know if I can support further.

I am delighted to announce that the OA Ebook is LIVE on Amazon Kindle (92 pages):
https://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Academy-practical-introduction-Protocol-ebook/dp/B0BHTQ7B1F/

The main content has been extracted from https://www.oceanacademy.io/
The goal was to share this knowledge repository beyond the website!

- Thank you, Jesus Hernandez and John Udoh for the editing efforts
- Thank you @zippy1979  for your guidance through the process.

**Amazon Kindle requires a minimum amount of 0.99$ (mandatory). **
However, I found a trick….

I can run a promotion (for 5 days total) FOR FREE DOWNLOADS!
**It will be active from tomorrow until Monday** 
Do not miss the opportunity!

Finally, feel free to add reviews on the kindle page. 
Your support will be much appreciated.

Thank you for your trust,

Sometimes great writers are just great, no matter how old the article. Below are some articles I think are relevant by J. DeBruin . 

@Wally in particular talked about interoperability on Wednesday's Ecosystem Lounge meetup. That Ocean was built from day 1 with this in mind, and it's longevity hinging in part to this, which we are seeing.

I recommend meeting up with our community in the Lounge meetups! Have a great weekend fellow ambassadors.

> The battle between Liz Truss and the head of lettuce is intense and evenly matched. The two combatants circle each other, sizing each other up. Liz Truss takes the first swing, but the lettuce dodges nimbly out of the way. The lettuce counters with a strike of its own, using its leaves to whip at Liz Truss's face. Liz Truss ducks and weaves, narrowly avoiding the lettuce's attacks.
> 
>  Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, the head of lettuce proves to be a formidable opponent, using its flexibility and quick movements to gain the upper hand. Liz Truss fights back valiantly, but the lettuce proves to be too much for her.
> 
>  In the end, the head of lettuce emerges victorious, having bested Liz Truss in a fierce and grueling duel. The lettuce stands tall, its leaves rustling in the breeze, as Liz Truss lies defeated on the ground.",,

What are the possible actions that we can take through a DAO on our DataNFTs and datatokens?

I have read about Fractional NFTs in the docs, where a group of people can hold a single NFT and govern actions related to that DataNFT and its datatokens. 
a) how can we implement this? Is there a smart contract (DAO) that is the owner of the minted DataNFT and Datatokens? and the actions that we take on the Data asset (updating, minting datatokens, managing roles) are voted for on the DAO contract and then sanctioned? 
b) Is there any helpfull repo or implementation of a working DAO in the ocean tools as of now?
c) Is this the only use case of implementing a DAO with Ocean Contract? or we can use a DAO elsewhere with Ocean Protocol?",,

The first bounty week has closed and we had very few submissions.

All of your contributions mentioning Ocean are invaluable, and duly so are in the running for bounties. Don't be shy!

Also take a peek at the new updated roadmap and new teams implemented at Ocean, super interesting and a lot to unpack here. https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051

Tell them, what you think and if you have any suggestions for improvement, or if you just want to point the things you thought were working well, that would also be valuable.

End of week reminder & wrap up:

✅ Please have all deliverables for this weeks bounties posted in the Acropolis by tomorrow, Friday, at midnight CET.

🗓️ Please make a note in your schedule to try and make our next OPAP meeting, on Thursday April 06, 17:00 CET in Discord #voice-channel https://discord.gg/b6bCbRgU. (Ambassador voice no longer exists)

The meetup is entitled 'Future Initiatives & Reflections' . What we aim to cover is upcoming use of Snapshot to use as a tool to vote on certain deliverables as the OPAP community, as well as what will be considered worthy of bounty payments outside the scope of what is currently posted. We will also discuss possible future bounties and want to hear your ideas as well.

:Oceancopy: As per next weeks objectives, let's try and maintain the momentum of focusing on OPF official events in Discord with the objective of getting more people curious to onboard to using Ocean.

Have a great Friday and weekend sailors! 🌊",,"Oceancopy (6),💙 (3)"

Hello Ocean peeps. I need help... well my friend Rafiki wants everyone to have a look and his post. Its regarding petition/show-of-support for keeping AI monopoly-free and keeping thing transparent.

Please read the petition if you have time  and please comment if you fee like it resonates with you some way.  🙂 

Or if you violently disagree :slightsmile: . Discussions are important to algorithms and feeds. 

Also make sure to poke fun at that weird commenter who talked about Ai baristas. That person may or may not be me, but his thoughts are weird so comment either way

Also thank you @blockchainlugano for allowing me to post. ~~ I can't wait till my existence is perma nuked from the chat~~",,❤️ (1)

In order to create content for Ocean, it's easiest if you understand how the mechanics of the protocol work. If you have not spent much time in this ecosystem and wonder how creating datasets, consuming them, 'staking' in veOcean work etc,  why not attend a free workshop hosted by OPF tomorrow? There are two sessions tomorrow. (check Ocean events calendar here in Discord)

We've got some great partners that are working on different parts of the decentralized AI stack who will be sponsoring bounties. The house is really nice too (check out some more pics in the attached slides) and there's free accommodation available.

There is a lot of alpha here and ways for you all to get involved and help build out Nouns. Remember this is not an OPF project, this is an initiative *by* and OPF core member, for the community, with the intent to be run *by* the community.

Team mates. We really need to get a handle on what's being posted in social media comms. 

I am taking an inordinate amount of time 1:1 to ensure you understand how the Ocean tech stack works, what it can and cannot do, etc.

BUT...some posts are simply inaccurate. If you have doubts about your post please ask in our channel before posting. 

Inaccurate data about this technology is worse than no posting. It is simply misleading to the public, and if you put Ambassador in your profile the assumption is you know, on a base level, the workings here.

This is proving to be untrue. Please read and review the massive amount of free writings put out by the OPF team, on Twitter, YouTube, github etc. To deep dive and come back to ask questions if you have them.",,"OPAPShield (14),👍 (6),💙 (1)"

Really chewed on this which is why today is Wednesday and normally this is done by Monday, but I am remaining shellshocked that 95% of the work put in is simply incorrect or incoherent, some on a large scale. None of you will win bounties this way, so IMO really read and ask questions to understand how this works, or you will be wasting your precious time for zero reward:

Here is an example, see if you can spot an issue, and this is taken from the top 2 threads submitted (good job btw, because it is nearly there!).

Part of a posted thread: 
Ocean Templates is an open-source toolkit from @oceanprotocol that provides a complete answer to common issues experienced in #blockchain dApp development. 

Reasoning this is not of useable quality: 
Ocean Protocol does provide a set of tools and infrastructure to help developers build decentralized applications (dApps) centered around data marketplaces. This includes the usage of templates that *facilitate* standardized data exchange agreements.

However, it's important to note that Ocean Protocol and its tools are specifically tailored to data sharing, buying, and selling use-cases. They may not address all the ""common issues"" experienced in general blockchain dApp development, but they do indeed provide significant benefits for those particular use-cases.

With that in mind, a more accurate statement might be:

Ocean Templates, part of the @oceanprotocol toolkit, provides a comprehensive solution to common challenges experienced in blockchain-based data marketplace development. This thread will inform developers how it can reduce complications and accelerate time-to-market for developing data-centric dApps.

:OPAPShield: **Always be sure to research the specific functionalities and scope of a particular toolkit or platform before making broad claims about its applicability and benefits.**",,"OPAPShield (7),💯 (7)"

:OPAPShield: We have in the last few months onboarded quite a few ambassadors which is a huge success for us and we have many more coming in. Although our Academy and requisite activities for onboarding are quite thorough, it generally takes time to fully grasp the many technical aspects of Ocean Protocol.

🤝 We are looking to begin fostering greater communication within regions and within our crew, and I highly recommend looking at the Meet the Team page in Notion where you can find fellow ambassadors in your own language or region. This would be a great help as many of you that have been here longer can assist in mentoring newer ambassadors that may have some questions or are seeking clarity.

📣 When it makes sense for the OPAP program, we are happy to support local meetups IF objectives and deliverables are clear. But the first step in this is to find fellow ambassadors and begin discussion, really be clear on the Ocean Protocol ecosystem and technologies,  and then you can reach out to @zippy1979 or @blockchainlugano for advancing this activity.

🧠 Also, don't forget a huge benefit to you ambassadors is each other. Many successful projects have been realized by ambassadors getting together, ideating and building (DeltaDAO, Dataunion, etc). There is a wealth of information between all the brains here, and we would love to see you using OPF's tools in creating amazing products for the decentralized forward thinking web3 space.",,"🫂 (12),ocean (9),OPAPShield (8),dolphin (6),✅ (6),💯 (2)"

Regarding the new PFP's, those of you that have claimed your ambassador badge will have already seen that yours has been automatically upgraded to the correct one.

We will be pinning a message here to explain the correspondence of badge upgrades to XP points and deliverables. There will also be a message in #🪢︱treasure-hunter covering this.

The new onboarding of ambassadors will now be for participants to have discourse and participation in the treasure-hunter channel, and it is up to US, the ambassadors and OPF core team to reward them with upvoting QUALITY comments, observations, scope of OPF in order to award them points. Each 💯 is worth 3 XP points. Please award these only if the participation warrants it. (gm, emojis, basic comments etc do not count). They will work their way up to 99 points of which then they will be prompted to apply to become an ambassador.

Ambassadors can also upvote one another and this is ONLY a part of you climbing up the ladder, bounties and referrals will be part of it (details will be pinned here in the channel)

The XP bot is to launch very soon, will let you all know when it does.",,👍 (11)

Please show up and drop a message or emoji so I may assign them to you. 

The XP points works in order to raise your score as you work your way to a higher role. Points are a part of it, bounty deliverables and successful outreach another. Visual cards will be pinned in the channel very soon.

Only Ambassadors and OPF core team may award XP points to anyone in the channel. I ask you to be CAREFUL when awarding them, they are merit based and only valuable, interesting and thought provoking messages should be awarded. 

✅ You can award the member by responding with the 💯 emoji. The rest of the emoji's will not award points so feel free to use those freely.

✅ XP points are awarded in value increments of 3 per emoji.

✅ Ambassador Leads have the capability of removing points, hopefully we should not have to do so often!

✅  You may check your points by calling the XP bot using `/check-xp`

✅ We are a crew and need to work together as such, working towards the same objective. Award those you feel really deserve it, don't be stingy, nor don't award flippantly.

✅ We want this channel to stimulate conversation, learning and action. You may of course use it to your liking, talking about alpha in the data world, web3, the data economy, etc. This is supposed to be fun.

It has taken us a long time to get here, the bot was built for OPAP and we hope this makes our activities fun and a bit competitive and more engaging for you. We will quite soon be running simple and fun bounties in the channel. 

If the bot stops working (as I am not always on) please DM @blockchainlugano  or @zippy1979 to resolve.",,"👍 (19),🔥 (5),😁 (2)"

From now on I will post these in these requests in the #🪢︱treasure-hunter channel and feel free to ping when completed there, I'd like to keep our channel fairly clean.

We already have a few new interested applicants for the program, so they will be joining the channel and begin their XP journey to get to 99 and be prompted to do a few additional steps in order to onboard. In the meantime please interact and help them discover all things Ocean Protocol. This is the objective, for newbies to understand how Ocean works before they become Ambassadors, and we need your help.

Those of you who assist meaningfully and respond with accurate and complete responses will also be rewarded by the community with XP points. The idea is circular. Let's prompt discussions and deep dives.

In return, you will earn 25 XP points and 25 USD of mOcean at the end of the month. This is something I am looking to rotate constantly to give everyone a chance.

Rep3 badges need to be the same wallet address as your payment address for simplicity and tracking your work. 

We always kept wallet addresses in a document open to all, which keeps maintenance a breeze, and I would like to go back to this if possible.  Let me know if this does not agree with you by reacting accordingly.

A few of you put forth some great material. Some notes:

*Be sure what you write is accurate and factual. When in doubt, ask core team in the main channel.

*Be original. A few lines of fresh content go much further than...'Did you know Ocean offers compute-to-data'. This has been tweeted for years.

*TikTok videos. Remember, winners are being added directly into OPF's account, not shared, so it has to be something OPF would themselves make. Think corporate, think funny, think timeless, think global.

My thoughts on it: 

The collaboration with Moonbeam Network signifies Ocean Protocol's expansion to the Polkadot blockchain. Initial integration will empower users to seamlessly ""publish, stake, and buy"" data within Polkadot's ecosystem. Assets from both Ethereum mainnet and Moonbeam will eventually coexist within the Ocean Market, a platform for data discovery and exchange. Enhanced privacy features, network bridging, and liquidity sharing are also on the horizon.

Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol, highlights the alignment of Ocean's multi-blockchain vision with Polkadot's interoperability focus. Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility makes it a logical starting point for Ocean's Polkadot venture. 

The Moonbeam team is constantly working to simplify the implementation process for Ethereum developers who want to migrate to Polkadot. Ocean Protocol chose Moonbeam as an extension point because of its unrivaled compatibility. The Ocean team can now utilize their existing Ethereum smart contracts to access the new and growing Polkadot ecosystem.",,💯 (3)

UTU's AI-driven trust infrastructure will assimilate data providers, consumers, datasets, and entities' interactions to construct comprehensive trust profiles. Moreover, Ocean users can rate and review these entities, all contributing to a dynamically analyzed trust signal.

This approach elevates trust and transparency within Ocean Market, minimizing transactional friction. Users can seamlessly access quality datasets from reliable providers, utilize data for analysis or stake, and avoid risks like rug pulls, fostering a more secure and reliable ecosystem

Furthermore, the UTU protocol rewards users for providing precise ratings and reviews while safeguarding their data privacy. Collaborating with Ocean will streamline the process for UTU users to monetize their data on Ocean Market as data providers. Users retain complete authority over shared data, deciding which to monetize and its usage terms.

The partnership aims to facilitate data exchange between their protocols. This entails incorporating publicly-available, on-chain UTU data like endorsements into Ocean Market, procuring relevant Ocean Market datasets for the UTU protocol, and analyzing datasets to generate UTU recommendations and insights.",,💯 (3)

The collaboration between Ocean Protocol and Moonbeam is important. It helps Ocean Protocol become part of another blockchain. It gives people more ways to work with data. It also allows them to make bets based on that data. All in all, these are new opportunities for Ocean Protocol.
Working with UTU is also a good thing. They are using artificial intelligence to help people trust each other when sharing data. So Ocean Market becomes a place to find safe and quality data. And UTU helps users make money from their data on Ocean Market.",,💯 (6)

It's deja-vu. 

Now that our community is growing I would like to test out awarding 2nd and 3rd place Twitter social media bounties, voted on by you, which I always thought to be fair.

So, back to Snapshot team. https://snapshot.org/#/oceanambassadors.eth/proposal/0x60a5eed28f4be3da100c75996a4ffabbc797cfc384efd12ef7fdd0d0ed3714d0

Your rep3 Ambassador badge gives you voting power. It is quadratic so you can spread your vote as you see fit.

Use the guild sheet we have (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14upEOy_slBoiWegN9gsScP2ugMvdN8LcfOxbDYYOIPI/edit?usp=sharing)  to understand which submission is what number. It's pretty clear, yellow column. Voting is open for 4 days since payouts do not go out until Sept. Let's rock this and I will be releasing the next round early next week once the winner is determined.  Again, for the moment this is Twitter only.",,✅ (4)

Regarding bounty round 36 (week before last) we had a major issue, and I was not able to look at them until mid-week this past week. Nearly ALL of the submissions were good  EXCEPT one major issue. Nearly all of you mention 'data is safe with secure data storage' !!! 
This is of course incorrect. Ocean has NOTHING to do with storage and you should all know that, one it was in the quiz to get in and two, by now with all you are reading so much about Ocean that this should be clear. Storage is up to the providor, and Ocean has no access to it, nor can verify what is in the data. 
So no, there were no bounty winners as the few that did have a correct thread were not written strongly enough to publish or they were about data farming which we agreed is not on the subject list.

Reminder on granting XP's in the #🪢︱treasure-hunter channel. Please grant points only for really interesting, high quality or original thoughts, or to new entrants who are making an effort to understand this. 
Repetitive answers or contributions should not be getting awarded multiple times. That in essence kinda games the system. I know it's frustrating and a long road to get XP's, but don't forget even us ambassadors that have been here years started at 100 when this was shipped. 
It's not a race, it's about contribution and quality. We all know Ocean is not a simple protocol, and we put these concepts in place to help people learn. We are working hard on finding novel and actionable ways to earn XP's.

The results are close from the community, which is good because that means you all recognize we have some great talent here! 🍻 
However, upon deeper diving, the winner has been changed to @Feno  for a few reasons, and I am pointing this out for all of your benefit so we don't make the same mistakes.
*the submission should have been for bounty round 38 due to post date on X.
*errors about when testnet, mainnet were online were incorrect in the thread (important bit), but posted correctly across OPF documentation (so double check your work)

The retweet already was fired off by OPF, so OPAP will be tweeting the winner along with the other top 2 during the week. 
Big shout out to @That Blockchain Guy for the emotional ride 🫂  and being the unfortunate subject of this lesson for all.

2️⃣  Quality based, as before, with a change up where the winner will get the $100 bounty reward, BUT will be chosen via blind vote by YOU, the Ambassadors.

Just wanted to drop here a little hack for the Twitter Impression campaign starting tomorrow. 

You can try these techniques to farm more impressions 😎

- Add hashtags with high viewerships. #AI could be an example, but there are more. Check the trending section and see if any of them fits. Remember too many hashtags are penalized by X so you want to select them carefully 

- Replies to posts with high views can be another way to farm impressions 

- Tagging other accounts can provide more visibility to your post. Add context to your post such that it makes sense to tag other companies.

- Pin your post to your profile to ensure you gain views every time someone visits your profile

- Sharing your tweet on Reddit or other social media can hugely increase viewrships

- the timing of your post/comment matters

I’d suggest to try them all to see which one works best for you. There may also be other techniques that I didn’t mention yet. 

If you get stuck do let me know! Happy weekend 😄",,🔥 (8)

Why can’t the winner be chosen in a normal way, by an objective and uninterested person from the team, like you for example?
This vote raises huge doubts:
1. To evaluate the quality of a written text, the examiner must have knowledge and he must read the text carefully and thoughtfully. That is, if a person did not participate in creating the content, then he must first read the material, understand it, and then check works. Who will do this?
2. Where are the guarantees that people who have a voice will even read what is written there? But they won’t give ratings randomly, based on just one picture, for example.
3. In fact, voters are rivals; the right to vote is a tool for various manipulations.
4. Variation with the formation of voting teams.
5. In the ambassador program, people communicate with each other, some closer, some further. It is clear that each person is not objective by default and will give more rating to his friend.

I think we can find more reasons to doubt. I just can’t understand why we need to break something that worked?",,👍 (5)

Then most people ask why things die and their money is lost, but its all made up and we can program whatever we want on a DLT provided the opcodes allow it.

Two hiccups. 
The winning bounty on metrics was actually @Qazim if you go by numbers. His tweet looks like it was taken down from being flagged at a certain point and thus was not eligible in the end. There was also a bug on Postmint, now fixed.

The tool spread with google docs led to 2 threads not making in the community vote, as submissions drop automatically from postmint when the threshold is not met. So they were added late, and went unvoted on.

A potential workaround is:
Condense BOTH metrics and quality on Postmint via 1 bounty. Community (those accepted in the campaign, meaning ambassadors) can rate the tweet directly in Postmint. So at that point both are evaluated at the same time, we can weight value to metrics vs rating.

We can as usual payout top 3. This reduces tool spread, and balances those who might play unfair with analytics, and rewards quality in one go.

Feedback? drop in https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/1166990250338431046/1166995018590990476",,

It also makes people stupidly petty for twitter posting. @blockchainlugano said it best. You should all build *stuff* so you can get business production experience.  I have developer firms and various affiliated services to help make quality Ocean themed campaigns. I feel like the general usage of the ambassador fund would be better suited for helping you guys and gals make more money and adding extensibliity to Ocean Protocol.

The main focus is to be used in IoT and real world use cases

In this method, one needs to like a post, and in return, they will receive a like. Many websites operate based on this strategy. To participate, you simply sign up and provide your account details. Then, you can select what you want in return: a retweet, a like, or a follow. The website uses a points system. To illustrate, let's say I like or retweet a tweet and gain 100 points. I can then use these 100 points to get what I want, such as followers. If someone follows me, I can choose to give them some of my points, let's say 5 points. So, those who need points can do the same as I did in the beginning to collect points. This is the basic idea of how it works.",,

News on this Friday.

After a long discussing with OPF yesterday, reviewing our objectives, it has been decided that rules on posting threads in Postmint are little to none.

*one may use any legitimate growth tool available to acquire impressions.
*you may tag whomever you see fit provided it makes some sense (like tagging PEPE doesn't but Fetch, or Elon, etc might.)

We will update the Postmint deets to reflect this.

This task is about metrics and nothing else.

That is why the bonus (quality) bounty pays out 2x the basic, to the best (I know many of you work really hard). We are also going to pay out 4 spaces for basic.",,❤️ (10)

They are providing moderation services to many different crypto projects and help communities in Discord and Telegram.
For each project they have a catalogue of facts that the moderator can learn from and are collecting answers to difficult questions to make your life as a moderator easier.

The requirements are good English knowledge and experience in Crypto. And I am convinced this is true for many of you here.

We continuously strive to keep our program fair and solid for everyone involved. It is evidenced in our pledge, our small team, our family like environment since the inception of the program.

Using Postmint, a new platform, has allowed us to try and automate certain aspects of our bounty program.

The last round is still not ready to be paid out due to ongoing questions we have with scoring and how to mitigate those attempting to game the system.

As a reminder, we ask that you abide by your signed pledge and participate in the program as an honest person. Doing anything less harms the program, delays payment, derails program enhancement, and just makes the program fail. 

Historically we had very few ambassadors since we value quality over quantity. We still believe this, but have relaxed onboarding a bit compared to 3 years ago in an attempt to get a more group feeling and inclusive not exclusive community. 

I encourage anyone here to use our channel to openly discuss issues you feel need to be addressed. And if you feel more comfortable please DM them to me and I will repost here anon. to stimulate discussion. We are a crew working together, there is no set 'captain' per se, let's move the boat in the right direction together.",,"👍🏿 (6),💯 (3),❤️ (2),🔥 (3),✅ (2),ocean (2)"

I finalized last weeks Postmint rewards. I had to manually adjust for a few things, and scores do not reflect metrics as its impossible to do. So, this is a one off but a lesson here.

*The best performing threads did not win. They should've been kicked out but I left them in the competition, but choosing Ocean's own marketplace is a lazy move. The objective was to think outside the box and either find a ecosystem partner or invent one.

*Due to not being able to score metrics, the points were arbitrarily awarded, in fairness to following instructions, and then best performing.",,❤️ (1)

I understand if you feel this was a good choice, and perhaps my wording was sharp. However, the point of being an ambassador is to educate the public and promote the tech space outside the obvious.
In fact I did not disqualify the threads, but left them in. Ocean market is not the focus on what Ocean can do, and we need to push traction and build outside of what is an obvious fallback, c2d was publicly shipped via the marketplace, but there are limitless builds that can be done with the tech.",,

The predictoor threads , which we have done several times in a row , fall under the same wording . And nothing terrible happened . The question sounded like this : Write about a dApp that uses Ocean's compute-to-data to create insights out of datasets available and add the use of datatokens to sell insights.           Following from the question, you need to write about 1) an application, 2) that uses compute-to-data technology , 3) create insights out of datasets available , 4) add the use of datatokens to sell insights. Under all these conditions, of all the applications, Ocean Market is exclusively suitable , other applications are not fully suitable, since they do not fulfill one or 2 conditions. Some do not create insights out of datasets available, some do not sell at all. At the same time, you put threads about the ephemeral use of technology ( which does not fit the topic at all ) . The above thread is about an application that perfectly matches the topic . I might as well have just written about some Ocean technologies without reading the topic at all , while not getting the risk of disqualification and accusations of laziness . Your criterion - Ocean Market is not interesting for users, since once upon a time there was a lot of information about it on Twitter - is absolutely unfair. I couldn't even know about it in theory. At the same time, Ocean market is a very useful  product that is worth attention. And judging by the number of likes, views and interactions, this thread was very interesting to my audience, it showed the best performance in the entire history of my activities.",,

The adjective used was in reference to choice in dapp. That it is Ocean's own seems logical that it would be covered to no end.

I think the wording of the task (Write about a dApp that uses Ocean's compute-to-data to create insights out of datasets available and add the use of datatokens to sell insights) perhaps was not clear enough, my bad, and it should've been creative and hypothetical. For those who could not do so reverting to something else out there that exists would be a logical step. There are many products using Ocean that fall into all the categories, that are using insights via the marketplace or their own. We could go into Dimitra, Datalatte, ones covered by other ambassadors. etc. We are trying to spotlight Ocean tech without being 'Ocean' as they have their own Twitter account and inhouse marketing team that covers what they are doing better than we ever could.

As per the metrics, I agree you had many. And the 3 hour workload to create this goes along with many other ambassadors who spend similar amounts on their thread. But I could not in good faith award the top tweets to ones that cover in essence what compute-to-data is instead of highlighting the workflow outside of the given pipeline.

DM me if you want to discuss further.",,

Furthermore, you should check out the Data Farming (DF) itself, because around 500M of Ocean will be released in that way and it constitute the mechanism for incentives good production and good allocation of High quality data set.

https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards/df-intro

To make it short, but you can also check a thread I made about:
Locking Ocean from 1week to 4years provides you veOcean (1 veOcean = 1 Ocean locked for 4 years).
Then every week you can earn ocean in two way with veOcean:
-Passive, just holding veOcean provide you weekly ocean 
-Active, you allocate veOcean to dataset and earn from that, this is strictly linked to the consume of the dataset.
you can also earn actively by participating in data challenges, also then are in active section of DF.

Lastly, you are lucky because we just entered In DF Main, after completed some beta phases, now we entered in the core phase of Data Farming.

Said that, I would really like a poker game built on ocean stack,  but in my honest opinion it shouldn’t utilise ocean token but a different token or an in-game currency that ofc can be then exchanged with ocean, just not utilising ocean as the in-game currency. 

Ocean is the currency of the new data economy and should be strictly linked to that, having it as in-game currency would probably dilute ocean value instead of accruing it. 

Lastly, remember that around 500M ocean token are destined to Data Farming, thus I would suggest to build a poker game that is directly linked to DF where DataNFT can be created with poker tendencies/spot evaluation/EV+ strategies etc, would definitely help you with that. 💪🏻",,💯 (1)

Because this blockchain primarily provides an infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of data in an open and secure environment, which has great potential to improve various industries and attract more participants in the field of decentralized data processing and without games.

This approach preserves data privacy, reduces the risk of breaches, and enables collaboration and analysis across organizations without sacrificing security.

Practical examples:

1.Medical Research and Privacy Protection
If a pharmaceutical company wants to collect patient data from different hospitals, then it would have to request patient data and store it, which would call into question the confidentiality of this data.
With Compute-to-Data, the hospitals can retain control over their data. The pharmaceutical company sends its algorithms to each hospital, where the algorithms run directly on the hospital's premises. The hospital's data remains secure within its own environment, and only aggregated results or insights are shared with the pharmaceutical company

2.Financial Fraud Detection
Consider a financial consortium that wants to identify patterns of fraudulent transactions across multiple banks. In a conventional approach, all transaction data would need to be shared or centralized, which poses risks of data breaches and unauthorized access.

Compute-to-Data can be employed here to address these concerns. Each bank retains its transaction data and deploys fraud detection algorithms locally. These algorithms analyze the data and identify potential fraud patterns. Only aggregated or summarized information about fraudulent patterns is shared with the consortium, without revealing the raw transaction details. This way, individual bank data remains secure, and the consortium still gains valuable insights for fraud prevention.",,💯 (4)

If I were to use the Ocean Protocol template and focus on building a specific application, I would consider creating a decentralized medical platform. It seems to me that confidentiality and data security, which Ocean Protocol can guarantee, are really important in this area. Thus, the creation of such a platform would allow medical institutions and patients to share and analyze medical data using a decentralized and secure infrastructure. This, in turn, would facilitate the rapid exchange of information between doctors, improve the accuracy of diagnosis and a more individual approach to treatment.

That is, this is information that can be valuable for business, it is always useful to learn more about your potential partners, especially if the contract provides for post-payment for delivered goods.

A future Ocean Protocol template would prioritize building a decentralized infrastructure that empowers individuals to retain control over their data. It would include advanced encryption and secure data sharing protocols to safeguard sensitive information. Additionally, the template would integrate AI-driven tools to anonymize and aggregate data, preserving privacy while allowing for meaningful insights.

Fair compensation mechanisms would play a vital role. Smart contracts would be at the core, ensuring transparent and automated payouts to data providers based on usage. These contracts could also factor in data quality and accuracy, incentivizing participants to contribute high-value data.

Interoperability and data standardization would be another focal point. The template would offer tools to format and structure diverse data types, making them easily understandable and usable across different applications and industries. This interoperability would foster a vibrant ecosystem of data buyers and sellers.

User experience would be key to adoption. The template's interface would be intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate, upload, and browse datasets. It would also provide clear explanations of how data is utilized, giving users confidence in participating.

To enhance credibility, a robust reputation system could be integrated. Users would be able to rate and review data sources, contributing to the establishment of a trustworthy data marketplace.

By prioritizing these aspects, the Ocean Protocol template of the future would create a dynamic and secure data market ecosystem, fostering innovation while respecting privacy.",,💯 (2)

Every song has its own soul, right? It's like a unique fingerprint. Got me thinking: What if every track, every beat, every lyric could be, I don't know, turned into its own digital asset? Imagine artists having these super-cool 'data tokens' for their music, thanks to Ocean Protocol, and using AI magic to enhance and share it.

To my musician buddies: How'd you feel about having the power to completely own and make money from your tracks in this way? 🎸
Fellow music lovers: What if we could dive deeper, connect more personally, and even influence the music we love? 🎧
Ocean fam: Doesn't this get you excited about the potential of Ocean protocol in the music world? 🌊

Would love to hear everyone's take on this. And hey, drop some song recommendations while you're at it! 🤘",,"❤️ (7),💯 (9)"

Turning music into digital assets through data tokens could indeed revolutionize the music industry.

So, for musicians, having data tokens for their music could empower them to have greater control over their work, ensure proper attribution, and potentially open up new revenue streams. With the help of AI and data analytics, artists could gain insights into audience preferences, allowing for more personalized music experiences and potentially influencing their creative direction.

For music lovers,  I must say this could deepen the connection to the music they love. It might enable more direct engagement with artists, support for their favorite tracks, and even influence artists' decisions based on data-driven insights.

In the context of Ocean Protocol, applying its capabilities to the music industry could create a decentralized ecosystem where artists and fans interact more directly, and the value generated is distributed more equitably.

Of course, like any transformative idea, there would be challenges to address, such as ensuring fairness in compensation, privacy concerns, and the technical aspects of implementing such a system. Nevertheless, the concept is thought-provoking and showcases the innovative potential of merging technology, data, and creative industries.

Old-school business? Centralized. Predictable. Now, thanks to Ocean, we're reimagining how the game is played. It's like flipping the board and introducing new rules.

1)Imagine a situation where the data marketplace for the Ocean Protocol dynamically modifies data prices in response to present-day demand or outside variables. The pricing of data assets on the market would be affected by the relevant data that Chainlink's oracles could retrieve, such as market trends, user preferences, or economic indicators. For instance, Chainlink oracles could offer the necessary external data to adjust the pricing in real-time if a particular dataset becomes highly sought after as a result of an emerging trend or event.
2) Smart Contracts Triggered by Weather: Chainlink's oracles may make it possible to build Ocean Protocol smart contracts that are triggered by actual events, like weather conditions. For instance, a user could configure a smart contract to automatically buy weather information from the Ocean marketplace the moment rain begins to fall in their city. Then, depending on the use, this information might be put to use to modify insurance rates, improve logistics, or set off particular actions in smart home systems.",,💯 (1)

An uploaded dataset to the Ocean marketplace, for instance, could be connected to Chainlink oracles that periodically check its integrity and make sure it hasn't been altered. The data would become more trustworthy and valuable to potential buyers as a result of this extra measure of assurance.
4) Building on Uber/Didi example from above, consider how users could integrate real-time user-generated data into the Ocean Protocol to provide details about traffic jams, road conditions, and other pertinent information. The incorporation of this user-generated data into smart contracts could be made easier by Chainlink's oracles, enabling applications like ride-sharing services to dynamically change prices, optimize routes, or improve user experiences based on the most recent information.",,💯 (1)

With the help of oracles it would be possible to provide data of all necessary organizations in real time, Chainlink is not the best representative of them, now on the market is actively developing a new type of oracles, the project is called RedStone, it just more dynamically uploads data from the modular design. 

These data would be purchased by insurance companies at the request of users, for example, there is a person who has insured his life and there is an insured event, then he sends a request for reimbursement to the smart contract of the insurance company, this smart contract immediately buys the data of the medical institution specified by the user and confirming the data it automatically sends money to the wallet of the client. 

Similarly we can say about the use of data of airline companies, you can buy data and track the delay of the flight, then a person right at the airport can apply and get reimbursement having a phone or laptop in hand.

In general, the example with insurance is very successful, it is something that is clear how to realize quickly and effectively. Everyone wins in this model, the organizations that own the data, the insurance companies, and the end user. It will significantly reduce costs and implementation time.

What do you think about using Ocean Protocol + oracle + Dapp (insurance company)?",,💯 (2)

🎯Data of High Quality: Ensure that the data being transferred is reliable, accurate, and pertinent. This can be accomplished by putting in place data verification systems and encouraging data suppliers to keep their data accurate.

🧇Create an incentive system that pays customers and data suppliers for engaging in the market. This could come in the form of prizes or other kinds of tokens.

 🚦Implement a flexible and open pricing system that enables data providers to determine fees by the worth of their data. This may draw additional users and service providers to the platform.

Hello, everyone! 🎨✨ I've been pondering over the weekend about the new era of digital art(What else is there to do in a market like this😅), of which we have become witnesses and users. It's truly an amazing time that marks a pivotal moment for all artists, photographers, and other creators of art. There have already been numerous cases at exhibitions and other competitions where Midjourney's creations were recognized as the best works in various categories, from paintings to photographs. This is a clear challenge between humans and artificial intelligence, which is capable of conveying the artist's intended image and emotions. I'm writing this to highlight the incredibly vast potential and the difficult-to-imagine prospects that lie ahead.

But, do you know how you can further expand this potential using Ocean Protocol? 🌊🚀

If MidJourney offers immense potential to realize any of your imaginations and you're capable of creating your unique style, then Ocean Protocol provides an extraordinary feature: it allows you to share, monetize, and publish all your styles, ideas, concepts, and imaginations.

Just imagine if our technologies were available to artists of the past centuries, like Salvador Dali, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and so on. Yes, there might have been many more artworks in these styles, but thanks to Ocean, this digital footprint would have been sealed at the moment of creation and with the creator's assistance.",,💯 (7)

However, we have the opportunity to share, monetize, and generate income from the most complex aspect: our ideas, our styles, and our concepts at various stages of their realization. People will use what you've come up with, your style and imagination, but it will always belong to you.

What are your thoughts on this matter? AI image generation is not the only option; the potential knows no bounds as everything stems from your ideas and concepts. I'd love to hear your perspective on this. 🤔🌟",,💯 (5)

They created and created, but no one noticed them at once, and some of them even during their lives. I think if the technology had been available to them, perhaps we would now know of other unique creators whose work has been lost or unauthored. 

I think NFT technology was originally created so that walkers could capture their art on the blockchain and have ownership of their work, but now NFT is being used to create slag projects to make money, it's sad, often the art is one of a kind and has no value to connoisseurs. But now we are at a point where this kind of art is not recognized by society and is rejected and only unique works have value. 

If we talk about AI for generating art, they all use prints of the works uploaded to them, this is a completely new genre of art, it is beautiful, it embodies the technology itself and its possibilities, but it is always necessary to separate the works created with the help of AI and works created entirely by humans.

The future is definitely for artificial intelligence, as it does the work in comparison with a person thousands of times faster and with a large percentage of efficiency. But this process displaces the work of a person, this is so and this is a normal process. Who will pay a programmer big money to create some code and wait months if AI can do it in 5 minutes? That's right, nobody. Also with paintings in the tens of thousands of beautiful paintings painted by AI, the work of an artist who spent half his life writing some kind of picture is very much depreciated.

But if we weigh all the sides, then of course there are more positive ones:
1. The effectiveness of AI actions is many times greater than that of a human.
2. Using AI is cheaper.

I'm not saying it's wrong to use AI nor am I for the position of using it in our everyday lives, I'm just stating that should it be used then moderation should be placed on certain tasks.

As a science lover ❤️ I'm opportuned to understand how evolution works and I'm sure most of you do too, and you'd agree with me that children born in the coming generation would only  get smarter and would make tasks that seem complex to you look simple before them, but you'd also agree that some things are lost in the process - Values, Ethics, Culture  **(This sums up the way of life of a group of people) ** and without this you'd definitely never get to see your Van Gogh nor will you see your Salvador Dali.

But the truth still remains as it is our environment that shapes us that makes us who we are. So maybe it's not soo bad that AI is the next evolutionary trend. There would also come in the next generation someone who'd look back and sigh as to how Midjourney has evolved since its creation. 

Like you've said we live in an incredibly fast paced world and we may not have seen it in the past but today's technology makes it even harder to stay in a place too long without hearing about  a new innovation 😂.

Thanks to ocean protocol, helps you provide extraordinary features in your creativity to help us share, publish, and monetize all our creativity and ideas.

Not here to convince you that Ai is not bad or is the best but can make use of both to enhance creativity to achieve the following
you can utilize both to boost creativity to do the following
Efficiency: AI systems that can generate images rapidly and effectively include neural style transfer and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This is particularly helpful in fields like design and entertainment where quick iteration is essential.

Creativity: Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of creating visuals from patterns and data, but it lacks the imagination and emotional heft that human artists bring to their creations. Human artists frequently incorporate their emotions, experiences, and distinctive viewpoints into their works, which leads to more emotionally relevant art.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a tool that complements human creativity rather than completely replacing it. A lot of artists use AI to improve their capabilities and integrate them into their workflow.

In summary, AI has brought efficiency, automation, and new possibilities to image creation, but it hasn't replaced the unique creative abilities and emotional depth that human artists bring to their work. The future likely holds more collaboration between AI and human artists, offering exciting opportunities for creativity and innovation.",,

Hello, friends! 👋 It's been great to hear many of your opinions about the future of digital art and Ocean Protocol, today I'd like to discuss with you how Ocean Protocol can contribute to the advancement of education.

In our technological world, education is becoming more accessible and diverse thanks to the internet and technology. Various courses, methodologies, textbooks – you can acquire valuable knowledge from almost anywhere in the world.

However, we can also encounter certain challenges, including effectiveness, ethics, and the quality of education. How can we ensure that educational materials are truly up-to-date, reliable, and don't lose their utility for students?

I believe that Ocean Market technologies can be used to create a universal market for educational data, where you can find, share, sell, or publish learning materials, as well as provide guidance to students throughout their courses.

Using these Ocean Protocol technologies, an open and fair data ecosystem for education can be established, where data serves to enhance the quality and accessibility of education for all.

So, what do you think about this approach? 🎓🌐 What examples of using Ocean Protocol for education can you suggest? Perhaps, in your educational journey, there were moments where this technology could have been beneficial. What advantages and risks do you see in such a data ecosystem?",,💯 (6)

In this area, I can think of a way to use the technology that the Ocean Protocol gives us: education involves the periodic preparation of various types of work by the student, which requires a huge involvement in the process. These can be term papers, desserts, some computational work, etc. So, from year to year, students receive the same educational program, that is, if the work is done well once, then it can be used next year for younger students who will go through this material. With the help of the ocean protocol, it would be possible to create a market where students could buy the works they need, on the right topics, in the right disciplines, and the creators of these works could monetize their work. Considering that each educational institution has thousands of students, this could be a good business, if you take into account the fact that your work will be relevant every new year, for new people. Something like that.",,

But it is possible to go further and create a separate market for educational data, not just a market but a platform on which tasks from the field of machine learning and possibly from other related fields will regularly appear. These tasks can be initiated by anyone and create a pool of rewards in the OCEAN token, then we can create a truly educational platform for people who want to develop in machine learning and data science. 

To summarize. A machine learning teacher or any other enthusiast creates a dataset and its tasks, then invites participants - students who contribute in OCEAN tokens, then the competition in the training starts and the winner or several winners share the reward pool consisting of their contributions. 

The result is a unique play-to-learn platform. And such a platform will not close, because participants always win, they get experience and education, and the best ones get OCEAN tokens!",,💯 (3)

Hello, Sailors! 👋 I think many of you have seen the news about X (Twitter) planning to introduce ID verification.

Since a significant portion of the crypto industry's audience is on Twitter, if the verification indeed happens, it could lead to a substantial user exodus from the platform, not just within the web3 community but overall. This prompts the need for a more honest and equitable alternative. From my personal experience, the decentralized social platforms I've tried had their pros and cons – some were relatively successful, while others weren't as much.

I'd like to engage in a discussion with you on this topic – could we build an ideal, fair, and truly decentralized social network analog using Ocean Protocol technologies?

Could we utilize data tokens? Imagine any user being able to create their own data token representing their profile. This would empower users to control access to their data and monetize their content and audience.

What if we incorporate Compute-to-Data? Enabling this option could allow other users or applications to perform various computational tasks on your data without exposing the actual data. For instance, you could decide whether to permit the analysis of your profile's tone, popularity, etc., without granting access to the actual posts. This way, users could safeguard their data privacy and security while enhancing the value of their profile for the development of new services and features.

Through Ocean Market, users can publish their data tokens on a marketplace, where they can find, purchase, or sell other users' data, explore interesting topics, trends, and more.

What are your thoughts on this matter?",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1113013155514290228/1143877734540517447/IMG_2455.jpg?ex=65df20a8&is=65ccaba8&hm=7b8fc7de64651fb16399c5007e1007504a8e302837b6a26c351e9833dbf4826e&,"💯 (2),✅ (1),🧠 (1)"

Although ocean protocols already helping with some parts of developing a decentralized social network, many other technological, sociological, and ethical issues need to be addressed to build a suitable and decentralized social network. These issues extend beyond the data interchange layer.

To create such a network, you would have to think about:

Decentralization: Ensuring that no one organization controls the network's infrastructure, governance, or data.

Data privacy is the protection of user data and the provision of control over personal data to users.

Censorship Resistance: Preventing content modification or censorship by any party, including the platform.

Even though Ocean Protocol can offer solutions for data sharing and access 

Ocean Protocol can offer access control and data sharing features, thoOceancean is well equipped but it's not a comprehensive approach to creating a decentralized social network.

If I understand correctly, users will create data tokens, where the data is their profile fingerprint, so you can make a data token but not disclose information from it to others. Ocean protocol technology can help with that.

Also when you create any content, articles, tracks, videos or artwork, that content will be permanently sealed in the blockchain with ownership, and you can use social metrics like likes, retweets, comments as data. That is, these social metrics will have to be converted into data and also linked to the parent content. It looks a bit complicated to me, but I think it is realizable. 

It is also possible to sell algorithms together with this data and introduce a calculation function, it turns out that the best Influencers will be able to further monetize their success, sell data about their content and metrics with ready calculation and formulas, then any beginner Influencer can quickly understand how to become more successful and publish really interesting content. 

But what if you add more AI to all this ? Such an algorithm that is able to analyze the text and the level of interest for other users, this AI can be a consultant when writing articles.

I think it is realizable, but it is quite extensive and complex work, the creation of a social network is already one of the most difficult tasks, taking into account decentralization complexity increases.",,

Hi, fam! 👋 I want to discuss with you the most important topic, which is health. I think many of us have smart watches, rings, and other accessories that allow us to track our metrics, help us in workouts, adjust our sleep and activity. Naturally, for these gadgets to function fully, your consent for processing your biometric data is required, which is stored on devices/servers/corporations.

But we live in a new digital era, don't we? The internet, social media, metaverses – all of these are becoming quite commonplace and are part of modern life. Does this mean that your data is your property, and you should be the one to decide how it's used? I believe so. Why am I bringing up the topic of health and biometric devices? 🌐💬

While exploring the Ocean ecosystem, I came across an interesting startup supported by Ocean Shipyard.

I'm talking about Brainstem.Health – a decentralized platform for collecting and utilizing health data obtained from wearable devices like watches, bracelets, rings, and so on. ⌚📈

The project's goal is to create the largest and highest-quality health data set accessible to all stakeholders, such as researchers, doctors, insurance companies, etc. Project users can not only track their health and receive analytics but also monetize their data by selling it on decentralized data markets, like Ocean Protocol.

The Brainstem.Health project interacts with Ocean Protocol through the Data Union technology. Data Union is a way to aggregate data from multiple providers into a shared pool that can be sold or utilized. It also ensures transparency, security, and fairness in data exchange. Data Union users can control their data, give or revoke consent for its processing, and receive rewards for their contributions. 📊🔒💰",,"💯 (7),🧠 (1),✅ (1)"

Ocean's technologies allow for complete confidentiality. However, on the other hand, would you be prepared to take a unique step into this new digital reality, considering that your data is indeed yours?

In the modern healthcare system and for one's well-being, health data and biometric tools are essential. The following are some benefits of health data collection:

Protecting people's privacy and security requires handling health data and biometric information carefully. The importance of data encryption and adherence to laws like HIPAA (in the United States) cannot be overstated.
Early detection and prevention: Health information gathered by biometric sensors, such as glucose meters or heart rate monitors, can assist in the early detection of health disorders. The prompt action and preventive measures made possible by this early discovery
 
Biometric information can be used to personalize medical care and treatment regimens to suit a patient's unique requirements. As a result, therapies are more successful and have fewer side effects.  

Chronic Disease Management: For those with long-term diseases like diabetes or hypertension, ongoing biometric data monitoring can help with better disease management and treatment plan adherence.

Research and development: For the study of medicine, compiled health information from a sizable population can be very helpful. It can be used to find patterns, risk factors, and prospective hot spots for healthcare innovation. All thanks to ocean protocols, which update all the data and make it monetized, shareable, and as well accessibility.

In summary, health data and biometric devices are instrumental in improving healthcare outcomes, enhancing individual well-being, and advancing medical research and innovation. However, it's important to balance the benefits with privacy and security considerations

1) I certainly believe that any personal data should belong only to its owner, but the collection of medical data is crucial, because it is the basis for research. If each user will sell the data by setting the price himself, then there may be a situation when the users of the application will overestimate the cost of data, which in the long run will reduce the number of conducted studies because the cost of them will increase. 

Solution: Make it possible for users of health monitoring applications to sell data for a fixed price or not exceeding a certain mathematically set price, or to refuse such a sale, it is also possible to introduce data rental, so medical institutions will pay for subscription to the service, the service will distribute this money among users. Excellent mechanics I think, although it still needs to be thought out in more detail!

2) In order to popularize such a platform it is also necessary that there is a demand for this data, if now this data can be collected in other ways and the person does not own his data fully, why should medical institutions (especially research institutions) buy data on the Ocean market ? 

Solution: We need to harmonize the change at the legislative level, i.e. introduce legislation that will prohibit any collection and storage of medical data in unencrypted form. This is quite a long way off, but it is still worth taking this step into the digital future.",,🔥 (2)

No one will buy patient health data on the market)) Where everyone can put their data and the price they want. The company will set a price for the data and simply collect it through the Ocean Protocol, there are plenty of people in the world who will agree to this, given the fact that the data can be collected anonymously, simply examined by the operation of computational algorithms in order to obtain statistics.
2) And now the law on the protection of personal data is in force, people's data is used either with their consent or illegally.

A typical example being the increase of blood pressure of a population over the spread of a flu..

Hello, folks! 👋🌊 This week we discussed numerous concepts and ideas, and many intriguing opinions were shared regarding integrating Ocean Protocol and enhancing our world together. Today, I'd like to delve into something more localized and discuss how we can apply Ocean Protocol for our own selves. 

As you know, having a unique style, reputation, and audience is crucial in the modern world. But how can we stand out and draw attention to ourselves? 🌟

What if we could create our own dataset about ourselves? Like a pool, or something similar. This could serve as a distinctive portfolio: showcasing examples of our work, contacts, photos, publications, and social media presence. 📊📸📚

By utilizing our dataset, we could promote ourselves across various fields, demonstrating our data pool to potential employers, clients, partners, friends, and acquaintances. This would help us build a positive image and enhance our value. And naturally, this could be used for monetization purposes as well. Imagine selling our dataset or its components to individuals or organizations interested in our information. Sounds intriguing, right? Additionally, this could have a positive impact within the Ocean Protocol community. 💰🤝

Through this practice, we'd be able to receive feedback from other Ocean Protocol users who could evaluate our data pool, offer advice, criticism, praise, and more. We could also employ different algorithms to analyze our dataset and receive valuable recommendations. For instance, we could discover our strengths and weaknesses, interests, goals, perspectives, and opportunities. 🔄📊🤖

What are your thoughts on this topic? Would you be interested in creating your own data pool about yourself? 🤔📂 And in your opinion, what advantages and risks might this entail? 🤷‍♀️📈",,💯 (5)

Often when you create your portfolio for a job you come to the conclusion that you need to create it again for each job separately, it is sometimes very tiring. But if you create a perfect portfolio of your successes, works, cases, publications and stories about yourself, it will be easier to manage this data. 

Look, we can create a pool of data that contains our whole life, and then show this pool to a potential employer, but it should not be just a pool, it should be very well structured with the help of an algorithm, it should be possible to address a specific aspect of a person's life, the one that interests a potential employer!

Also often people are faced with the fact that they can not find themselves in life and try different things - it's great, but there are times when a person can not understand what of all that he tried really suits him ? And here to help will come the opportunity to analyze life and understand what most of all brought a person benefit, in which he is really good! This may encourage more active development in this direction. And this is thanks to Ocean Protocol is feasible, I am ready to try to do it.

Now let's talk about the risks. This kind of data pool is a bit scary to share with other people because it contains a lot of personal information and who knows what unscrupulous marketers or even your acquaintances or employers might do. Even though they don't own the data pool, they may find out information that allows them to manipulate you.

Having control over your data may have the following benefits:

Privacy Control: You are in charge of managing and safeguarding your data, choosing what information to share and with whom. This can reduce worries about privacy.

Data security: By putting strong security measures in place, you can guard your data from breaches and illegal access.

Data monetization: In some circumstances, you can decide to share your data only with certain parties and even make money off of it by selling it to businesses or taking part in data-sharing initiatives.

Customization: By making the data pool specifically for your needs, you can make sure that it contains information pertinent to your interests and way of life.

Data Security: To prevent unwanted access to your data, you can put in place strong security measures.

Data Monetization: In certain circumstances, you may decide to give or sell your data to businesses or researchers to gain financial gain.

It's crucial to keep in mind that maintaining a self-data pool has obligations, particularly those related to data security and privacy. Encryption, backups, and compliance with data protection laws must all be done properly to maximize benefits and reduce dangers.

Let's talk about the future with Ocean Protocol. I'm curious, how can it change the game in data processing? And, of course, how will that impact our lives? We're all discussing how data could become more open and accessible. But what if it extends to fields like science, architecture, and other cool areas? By the way, can Ocean Protocol make it so that companies turn data into awesome products and services?

Also, we've heard that Ocean Protocol wants all participants to get their share of fame and rewards for their efforts. Seems fair, right? But I think there might be some hurdles in this process. Maybe someone has ideas about potential challenges?

And hey, what do you think is important for Ocean Protocol in the future? Collaboration, partnerships, and security, for instance. What if everything goes ""boom"" and then disappears? What steps can we take to prevent that?

Let's start with the first one. Let's take very important spheres: science, architecture, medicine. Open and accessible data can change these fields very much. For example, a number of researchers collect data on a field and start researching it, but he realizes that he should involve more people in this research, then he can post this data and his findings on Ocean Market, then other researchers will join and work together on the problem, which will be solved much faster. And so we get an increase in the speed of technology adoption and discovery, which ultimately affects all other aspects of society. 

I honestly don't see a problem with reward and glory for effort. After all, all of the users' actions and contributions are publicly available, it is clear to us who did what. The only thing that can be controversial is the degree of contribution of each participant, it is determined subjectively and it is not very clear how to determine it more effectively.

Of course, all three things are important. But the most important aspect is partnerships, they feed the ecosystem with new projects and ideas, which in the long run will lead to a growth in popularity, maybe even without a ""boom"", just a gradual growth.",,💯 (4)

For example, you can take the restaurant business. Let's say a lot of restaurants collect data about customers' food preferences and then by collecting a pool of data we could analyze what people like most and create a very relevant menu. Making menus for restaurants is quite a difficult task, this way we can make it easier. 

We could also collect data on experiences with bad habits and find effective methods that help most people to quit smoking, for example!",,

A simple case scenario where every patient file is a DataNFT containing datasets of health-related actions and activities ( maybe you could also include heath records connected to a health-device. Eg Wrist watch or an Automated Sphygmomanometer ) which is secure and made accessible by holding datatokens to said data.
Under terms & conditions the patient is made known the choice to monetize their health data records for larger companies so as to also earn money from them.💯

One major hurdle you might want to look out for in this niche  would be its open source potential. Someone might actually purchase this dataset for underhanded purposes with the patient being non the wiser.🥲

In a theoretical future data is KING 👑 and what better way to obtain more data than COLLABORATIONS 🎉, should we wish/ choose to stay afloat this ever-changing ocean🌊of technological advancements then I feel collaborations are the way to go.
And with collaborations come the concern of security. I do not know the intricacies of the technical aspect of the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem buildup but that should also be of primary concern.

Improve Usability button: One of the most important aspects could be to improve the user interface, making it even more intuitive and user-friendly. To do this, you need to analyze the experience of users interacting with the platform, especially new ones! For example, by means of a survey.  

Compatibility Button: Making Ocean Protocol easily compatible with other decentralized technologies can greatly enhance its capabilities. Integration with other data ecosystems would help create a richer ecosystem. 

Button management and fair rewards: A system could be created that ties rewards to value contributed, which would help increase engagement and collaboration. This can be done based on statistics collected on each community member. 
Educational Activities Button: Expanding educational activities can help expose the concepts of Ocean Protocol and decentralized data sharing. Workshops, tutorials, including in different languages will allow more people and businesses to use the platform effectively.

As for important values to preserve and create: 

Transparency: Transparency in decision-making, governance and data management processes will build trust and credibility in the community. Clear communication of updates, changes and improvements to the protocol is important. This can be done by publicizing all updates in real time. 

Inclusivity: Creating an inclusive environment where different perspectives are considered in the design process will create a more comprehensive platform that meets a variety of needs.

Community collaboration: Encouraging collaboration and feedback from the community fosters a sense of ownership and shared responsibility for the success of the platform.

How can Ocean Protocol, the innovative platform for data exchange, play a crucial role in preserving and transmitting information across generations?

Imagine a world several decades from now, where data takes on a new dimension and becomes a heritage passed down from one generation to the next. Ocean Protocol, designed for decentralized data exchange, opens up exciting prospects for preserving and continuing our digital identity.

In this hypothetical reality, you get to decide what aspects of your data become heritage. It could be your scientific research, works of art, family archives, or even business strategies. And here is where Ocean Protocol steps in.

Imagine being able to store your research and knowledge on the Ocean Protocol platform. Your children, grandchildren, and future generations could access this data, drawing lessons and inspiration from your experiences. Even the art you create could become part of this digital heritage, ensuring your creative expressions live on beyond your lifetime.

Also, consider a scenario where business models and strategies become part of the digital legacy. Ocean Protocol provides an environment where this experience can be shared among entrepreneurs. This means that future business leaders could learn from the mistakes and successes of their predecessors.

So, picture a future where your digital heritage doesn't simply vanish but becomes an integral part of our collective experience. Share your thoughts: What types of data would you want to preserve, and what stories and lessons could be passed down through Ocean Protocol?

Could you please provide your insights on this?",,"❤️ (3),💭 (2),💯 (6)"

Even though there may still be some vulnerabilities due to malicious assaults or human error, it is evident that we have come a long way in terms of protecting sensitive data.
As we continue to refine our practices and strengthen new technologies, it is fair to say that we look towards a future where the majority of documents are protected and secured.
Now, all thanks to these ocean protocols, for effective data protection measures, ocean protocol data 💽  most especially in biometric data can be stored and monetized and preserve historical data for future generations. Such technology will allow future generations access to the archives and resources we have been gifted with, regardless of their geographical location.

What technical challenges and complexities can arise when working with vast volumes of data through Ocean Protocol, and how does the project address these issues while ensuring data security, efficiency, and scalability in a decentralized environment?

As we explore Ocean Protocol, we can see that the project aims to provide access to vast amounts of data, including those that can be measured in petabytes and exabytes. However, at such scales, several technical challenges emerge. For instance, how does one ensure fast data transmission and low latency when exchanging data among participants? How is the secure storage and transmission of sensitive data ensured, considering potential security and confidentiality threats?

Additionally, an intriguing aspect is how Ocean Protocol manages the scalability issue. The constantly growing volume of data requires efficient methods of compression and resource management. What technical innovations and solutions are employed to optimize data storage and transmission in a decentralized environment?

Lastly, what measures are taken to ensure high data availability and network reliability within Ocean Protocol? What distributed database technologies and monitoring tools are used to detect and resolve failures?

1) Data Transmission and Low Latency:
Ocean protocol has created a decentralized system for data transmission, data is not transmitted by itself, Ocean protocol does not store it, it is stored in other data providers like IPFS, Github and others. Thus Ocean protocol allows you to create a DataToken that gives access to data by means of a link to this data in third-party storage services. Therefore, the speed of data transfer is quite high, because you do not transfer the data itself, but only access to it with the help of a token. Since the base of the protocol is a blockchain, the delay will be minimal because not too much data is transferred.

2) Data Security and Confidentiality:
Ocean Protocol incorporates encryption techniques, access control mechanisms, and privacy-preserving technologies.
As already mentioned data is transmitted in the form of URLs, but all these links are securely encrypted, it is not possible to access the link (to the data on this link) if you have not purchased access to the data. In addition, for especially important data that must remain confidential there is a special service C2D, so the data provider provides access not to the data itself but to algorithms over the data set and can control the disclosed data and its parameters. For example: If there is a set of medical data, using the C2D service it is possible to sell data calculations, i.e. the buyer will get for example the number of patients or the average age of a certain group of patients, etc., but he will not get any confidential data from this set, what he will get directly depends on the algorithm used. In addition, after the data computation is done, only the log and the results that the algorithm created are returned, and the set itself and the algorithm are deleted, which ensures the confidentiality of the data.",,💯 (1)

Ocean Protocol employs distributed storage solutions, including IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and decentralized databases like OceanDB. These technologies allow data to be distributed across multiple nodes and scaled as needed. Data sharding and partitioning techniques may also be used to optimize storage and retrieval. Furthermore, decentralized resource allocation mechanisms, such as blockchain-based token incentives, help manage resources efficiently.

4) Regarding data availability and reliability, I can't answer this question as I haven't found any information about it. But I can assume that replication and backup strategies can be used to ensure data availability, but again they are used in decentralized databases, and Ocean protocol does not store data, this task is handled by third-party services and databases.",,

So, to ensure high data availability and network reliability in ocean protocols

We need to be observative in the following database technology  ☎️ 

Data Replication: In a network, data is frequently copied across several nodes. Due to this redundancy, the data is kept accessible even if some nodes go down.

Incentive Mechanisms: To motivate network users to provide dependable data hosting and maintenance, many ocean protocols include token incentives. This encourages data suppliers to guarantee high availability.

Data Provenance: Keeping a record of the data's provenance, which includes its origin and history, aids in building confidence in the data. This openness improves the data's dependability.

Disaster Recovery: Robust disaster recovery plans are essential to deal with unexpected outages or data loss. This might involve regular data backups and redundancy measures. So I think 🤔 and suggesting that the above point will help a lot in data availability and reliability in ocean protocol.",,💯 (1)

Firstly, handling vast volume of data through ocean protocol can present several technical challenges and complexities such as:

Scalability issue: Dealing with large datasets can result to straining ocean protocol capacity, thus resulting in slowing down data retrieval and processing of such date.
Security threat: It’s prominent to note that large datasets are attractive targets for cyberattacks. Therefore resulting to data breach, data theft or even data manipulation. 
Depreciation of decentralization: Maintaining decentralization while handling vast data volumes is challenging. In other words, handling vast amounts of data may lead to compromise in the decentralized nature of ocean protocol. 
 The fore mentioned challenges are the well notable complexities I believe ocean protocol can face while working with vast volume of data. 

Nevertheless, Ocean Protocol has tackled this possible complexities that can arise while working with vast volumes of data through the following technologies:

Blockchain Technology: with the adoption of blockchain technology, particularly Ethereum, which provides security through its decentralized and immutable ledger, ocean protocol have tackled the issue of security threat. Transactions and data shared on the ocean protocol blockchain are cryptographically secured. Thus, enhancing data security. 
However, scalability can be a challenge on some blockchain networks, which is why Ocean Protocol explores Layer 2 solutions and other optimizations which improved scalability significantly in relation to working with vast volume of date.
C2D:  With the adoption and implementation of C2D, ocean protocol have prevented sensitive data from being exposed during computation, improving security while also potentially reducing the need for extensive data transfer. Therefore, contributing to scalability.
Data NFTs and Datatokens: The introduction of data NFTs and customized datatoken contracts has played a huge role in tackling scalability issue. The former and the latter has provided more flexibility and control over licensing arrangements. This flexibility has significantly contributed to scalability by accommodating different use cases and business models, thus attracting a wider user base.
These technologies have addressed aspects of both security and scalability. Thus achieving a robust security and high scalability in a decentralized data sharing manner. 

Question 2:

Regarding to the question: how does one ensure fast data transmission and low latency when exchanging data among participants?, one can tackle this challenge by making sure that the foundational systems, such as networks, storage, e.t.c, can easily grow sideways to handle more and more data. For example, Ocean Protocol adopted GEN X modular framework which aided to maintain fast and efficient data exchange which aligns with my idea of scalable infrastructure. 
Relating to the question: How is the secure storage and transmission of sensitive data ensured, considering potential security and confidentiality threats?, ocean protocol adopted a decentralized architecture which spreads data across multiple nodes, thus reducing the risk of an unauthorized access. Moreover, since data is not stored in a centralized archive, it is hard for malicious actors to target a single location. Lastly, 
ocean protocol utilizes ERC 20 datatokens to represent ownership and access rights for specific datasets. These tokens aid to secure and standardize data trading within ocean protocol ecosystem.

 Question 3

As I mentioned earlier in response to question 1, Ocean Protocol effectively addresses the scalability challenge through the adoption and implementation of various technologies. These technical innovation include blockchain technology, C2D, Data NFTs, and Data Tokens. These innovations collectively optimize data storage and transmission in a decentralized environment, ensuring efficient resource management.",,💯 (1)

As I mentioned earlier on, ocean protocol employs decentralized architecture which spreads data across multiple nodes, thus reducing the risk of a single point of failure. Therefore, this redundancy enhances data availability and network resilience. Moreover, Data can be stored on multiple nodes which is an effective way to enhance redundancy. Therefore, In case one node experiences downtime or difficulty, others can provide access to the same data.",,

🙋‍♂️ Hi GM friends! Data privacy is a topic of great importance and in the last months it has become even more important. As more and more data about people is collected and stored, it’s essential to ensure that this data is used responsibly and adequately protected against unauthorized access, but how can we be sure that centralized companies guarantee this? Eventually we are not sure 👀

Democratizing Data with Ocean Protocol

Ocean Protocol has a clear mission: to democratize data by leveraging technology and governance, leading to more equitable outcomes. To truly understand the importance of this mission, let's take a deeper dive into the realm of data.

In today's digital landscape, we often encounter meticulously timed and targeted advertisements on our screens. These ads are possible due to extensive data collection from various sources such as social media activity or website browsing history. However, it is disheartening that only a select few companies reap significant profits from this valuable resource—data.

Moreover, concerns around privacy loom large in relation to data collection practices. Many users worry about their personal information being harvested without informed consent for financial gains made by third parties. In fact, recent instances like France fining tech giants Google and Facebook highlight these apprehensions where user tracking was conducted against individual preferences.

Data holds immense value; its potential profitability cannot be understated. Nevertheless, maintaining control over one's own information while ensuring privacy remains an ongoing challenge—a predicament deserving attention given how little profit typically trickles down towards those who actually generate the underlying dataset themselves—the owners of said-data.

This is precisely where Ocean Protocol steps in as an innovative solution provider—an avenue aimed at enhancing transparency within the world of big data through blockchain implementation.",,

Highly recommend to see the Gaia-X Hackathon showcase Compute-to-Data, a privacy-preserving approach for sharing and monetizing data. It allows running compute jobs on-premise while minimizing privacy risks. This enables data marketplaces and new business models for data owners. Third-party portals demonstrated its applications, such as satellite image service and predicting heat demand in data centers using machine learning. The goal is to unlock data assets and generate valuable insights without moving the data around.",,

Well I believe C2D has played a huge role to tackle and solve the issue of lack of privacy in data by adoption and implementation of C2D technique. In a nutshell, I believe C2D has tackled this issue significantly by allowing data to stay secure on a premise while enabling third parties to perform computations like statistical analysis or AI model development. 

For an instance,  Tobe Klein corp, a pharmaceutical company, holds a valuable medical records database but needs to protect sensitive patient information. When Alliance.co seeks access for statistical analysis to identify trends in patient health. Moreover, Tobe Klein corp uses ocean protocol’s C2D technique. This will allow the former to keep the data secure in house, perform the analysis without exposing raw data, and share only the anonymized analysis results with Alliance.co . Thus, preserving data privacy while enabling valuable insights for research. Thanks to C2D, Tobe Klein Corp can securely share and monetize its data without compromising privacy. 

C2D as employed by Ocean Protocol, fundamentally addresses the prevailing issue of data privacy in contemporary data handling. Moreover, this technique enables secure and controlled data computations, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential while allowing valuable insights to be extracted. By integrating C2D, Ocean Protocol offers a robust solution to the challenges associated with data privacy, fostering responsible and privacy conscious data sharing practices. Therefore tackling the prevailing issue of lack of privacy in data handling.",,💯 (1)

Let's start with the importance of data confidentiality. Centralized companies ensure confidentiality with the help of a confidentiality agreement, that is, they essentially assume this responsibility, but if you read the agreement more carefully, you can often find deliberately created loopholes in this agreement, from here it follows that the confidentiality of data is not adequately covered and all your data essentially belongs not only to you but also to the company, which can disclose them in certain conditions and to certain organizations or authorities. Thus, the confidentiality agreement is just a formality and dust in the eyes. 

:ocean: In Ocean Protocol data confidentiality is provided by two technologies at once, firstly it is data encryption (links to data on the market), that is, without buying access in the form of a data token no one can get access to your link. Second is the C2D technology, it works in such a way that you can load any algorithm over your dataset, which will calculate only what you allow, such as statistical values, after the launch of this algorithm by the buyer and made calculations on a third-party server (today was launched the latest version of C2D on GCP) the buyer receives the data that should have been calculated and the algorithm automatically removes itself, the data and everything that is associated with them. In this way complete data confidentiality is ensured, no one will ever know the data of a particular observation from the sample unless you ask for it. 

I believe that this technology is simply brilliant in its execution, I have not seen it before and I think that it has a huge potential in the future.🙌🏻",,💯 (1)

DATA NFTS AND DATATOKENS
Ocean simplifies the process of publishing and consuming data services in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With Ocean, users can deploy ERC721 data NFTs and ERC20 datatokens, turning crypto wallets, exchanges, and DAOs into data wallets, exchanges, and DAOs.

Data NFTs and datatokens serve as the connection between data assets and blockchain/DeFi tools. This allows for the creation of data wallets, data marketplaces, data co-ops, and more through DeFi composability. The actual data does not need to be stored on-chain, only the access control.

Ocean-based apps make it easy for end users to access and interact with data assets, while Ocean smart contracts and libraries simplify the development process for developers.

Data NFTs represent ownership of a unique asset using the ERC721 standard, while datatokens repurpose ERC20 crypto wallets as data wallets and crypto exchanges as data marketplaces.

By bridging the data industry with DeFi assets under management, datatokens bring more value to the DeFi space by optimizing yields and capital efficiency.

Decentralized access control is combined with a user-friendly experience for both developers and users.

How It Works
Data NFTs are ERC721 tokens that represent unique assets, while datatokens are ERC20 tokens used to access data services. Each data service has its own data NFT and one or more types of datatokens.

To access a dataset, you need to hold 1.0 datatokens.

To grant someone else access to a dataset, you simply send them 1.0 datatokens. It's as simple as that.

Since datatokens are ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet, they can leverage the entire ecosystem built around ERC20 tokens.",,

Hi friends and GM! A few days ago i read a post on Twitter/X about some changes in the privacy policy of Twitter/X in which it mentions that it’ll be using the data of all users to train its machine learning and artificial intelligence models. In the same tweet, Elon Musk commented that no private personal data would be used, and that’s quite interesting topic 👀
    
  - That means that Data will become even more valuable in the coming months and years for sure, this open a huge potential for decentralized Data markets such as Ocean Protocol, maybe it’s time to get our data from all platforms specially from Social Media platforms and start to monetize our Data. Datalatte is a very interesting project of Ocean Ecosystem.
    
Projects that are focus in this direction have a lot of potential to growth, starting with rewarding users directly for their DatSets, so i found this a quite interesting! this is a large process, we can imagine companies/users that are working in some implementations about AI, and they need more and more Data to train Machine Learning systems, they'll buy these DataSets through OceanMarket, creating a completely Data Economy. What do you think about these great opportunities for Ocean Protocol? Here is the link of the Tweet.

Indeed, yesterday we already discussed the topic of data privacy and Twitter is one such center that collects user data, although they say they will not collect users' personal data, but they can still do it physically! In this case I'd rather turn to DataLatte and provide my data and get a fee for it, as far as I know they conduct regular surveys on various topics and then use this data in research. I want the research to be easier and faster, and I want the results to be useful to society, so I'd better give my data to them, because I'll get a reward for it! Besides, it will be fair, because I will provide the data myself, not just use social network and give it to someone for nothing..... 

I think in the future projects like Datalette and Ocean Protocol will be key in the new decentralized data economy, because these projects already have a strong and ready ecosystem.

I absolutely agree with you. It’s great to witness the huge revolution of data ownership from web2 data monopoly to web3 data ownership.
Moreover, it’s great to witness that the monetization of datasets has indeed improved significantly over the years. For instance, in 2022, Datalatte released datasets for Netflix viewing, where users could access a steadily expanding data pool of 450+ users for $1. This is indeed exemplary, showing that the monetization of data has improved immensely. I can't wait to witness the potential of the monetization of datasets on the Ocean Protocol.
Lastly, I believe Ocean Protocol's model of enabling companies and users to buy and sell datasets can indeed have significant potential. It can help address the data scarcity issue that many AI projects face, with major companies such as Google, Facebook, and Apple facing charges regarding unethical use of user data.

So I think that a possible solution for high quality data is the economic reward that exists, we are in a sea of innovations and new technologies, we have seen it with DeFi, play to earn games, activities that encourage people to make a action and I think that would help in the data economy.

🌊Hi Hi my friends! We can talk about different AI tools that we are using in our daily lives, in recent months many very interesting tools have been developed, I think the one we know the most is chatGPT. However, there are some other interesting ones that we can discuss the uses cases and the potential.

Some that i usually use, is perplexity.ai, an extension that helps summarize the pages you browse, in addition to dividing them by section and asking the AI to do a specific thing.
💻i've also used Notion for a long time, I think everyone here knows it and I find it extremely efficient that it has integrations with AI, so that it can do something possible automatically and quickly, as you already know, create databases, calendars, tables, etc and this of course save a lot of our time 😄

🎨Canva and Figma have generative artificial intelligence integrations, from text to image, which is pretty good and I think the images are improving 👀 i would like to know some others interesting AI tools! let's discuss some of them oceans!",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1113013155514290228/1149252249650999296/nnnnn.png?ex=65e03910&is=65cdc410&hm=58e94d9fd9eee54fa44ae7caf72a3dbe9fd8968d45b9011d45422e15d36f073a&,💯 (7)

But I also feel that the job is far from complete considering that the Human-AI collaboration still needs a lot of improvement.

Before AI, designers were allowed the freedom to express themselves in their designs even though it mostly took a lot of time to complete, but it was certain that the final outcome was a result of the designers choice. 
But the case is different with the introduction of AI, as users - not only designers, are able to achieve amazing designs in very little time, but at what cost: users mostly have to sacrifice total control of the final design outcome for speed and in most cases the user might still have to spend a considerable amount of time retouching the final design to suit their taste/requirements or settle for results generated by the AI.",,💯 (2)

💻GM friends! Something we have been hearing about for the past few months regarding the risks and dangers of AI is that millions of current jobs will be displaced in the future. This generates worry and uncertainty about disruptive technologies. However, just as AI is already capable of performing some office jobs better than people, I think the tone may be exaggerated about AI definitely replacing many jobs. Rather, the functions in many jobs would change.

🌊 So, if we look at it from an impartial point of view, I believe that the benefits are immense in the application of AI algorithms to make many processes for thousands of jobs more efficient. My question to all of you would be, to what extent **could AI replace/occupy current jobs by 2030**, and what would be the new jobs that would emerge?

Replacing certain manual tasks with AI can reduce labor costs and operational expenses, making businesses more competitive. AI can process and analyze vast amounts of data, helping organizations make data-driven decisions and gain insights that would be difficult for humans to obtain (new algorithms & deep learning) but that doesn't mean they control all our jobs!

    1. **AI and Machine Learning Specialists** : Demand for experts in AI, machine learning, and data science is on the rise as organizations seek to develop and implement AI solutions.

    2. **AI Trainers and Ethicists** : There is a need for individuals who can train AI systems, ensure they operate ethically, and address bias issues.

    3. **AI System Developers and Engineers** : Professionals who can design, build, and maintain AI systems are in high demand.

    4. **Human-AI Collaboration Specialists** : Jobs that involve working alongside AI systems, such as AI-assisted healthcare professionals or AI-augmented customer service representatives.

    5. **Data Analysts and Data Scientists** : The need for individuals who can extract insights from data, which is a crucial component of AI, is growing.

    6. **Cybersecurity Experts** : As AI adoption increases, the demand for experts who can protect AI systems from cyber threats also grows.

To uphold fairness, proper checks should be done on proposed predictions models before implementing / administering them. This would go a long way in having perfect prediction models, fair decentralized markets and help shape future activities for the best.

For inclusivity and global equity, I’d suggest two major things:

1. Decision making shouldn’t be one sided. This kills a perfect system overtime. Every party should be involved in decision making so that they won’t be left out or excluded.

2. Preferential treatments or policies shouldn’t be allowed. Regardless of real life positions and outside space involvements, no data should be given a better treatment than the others

Data Quality: Both AI and medical research depend on high-quality data. A marketplace can validate and curate datasets, lowering the chance of using unreliable or skewed data.

Cost-Efficiency: Data can be acquired economically through the use of a market. By purchasing data from a reputable marketplace, researchers and AI developers can avoid the significant costs related to data collecting and cleaning.

AI creativity can have both positive and negative impacts on human creativity. Here are some key points to consider:

Collaboration and Inspiration: Human creators of art, music, and literature can draw inspiration from AI-generated works. Artists, musicians, and authors can work with AI systems to improve their creative processes or use AI-generated content as a starting point.

Efficiency and automation: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can automate tedious and time-consuming processes, freeing up human producers to concentrate more on the imaginative and original components of their work. This may result in greater output and the investigation of fresh creative concepts.

Exploration of New Frontiers: AI can push the limits of creativity by producing original and out-of-the-box ideas that people might not have come up with on their own. This may provide new opportunities for human creativity and promote experimentation.

Negative Impact 
Dependence and Stagnation: A reliance that is too great on AI-generated material may result in a decline in human creativity. The ability of producers to generate ideas and material may stagnate or decline if they rely too heavily on AI.

Originality and authenticity: Artificial intelligence-generated content might not have the same depth of emotional and personal experiences as human producers do.

I'll like to say, concerning your point: ""Dependence and Stagnation"", don't you think it's inevitable? 
Take cars or other primitive means of transportation for example, before their invention/discovery, humans used to transport themselves by foot. But now we almost totally depend on them to transport ourselves.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer, as the best approach will vary depending on the specific task or application.

For instance A doctor wants to use AI to diagnose a disease. The doctor knows that AI can be helpful, but also that it can make mistakes. So, the doctor uses the AI system to generate a list of possible diagnoses, and then reviews the list with their own knowledge and experience to make a final diagnosis.

This scenario illustrates how AI and human wisdom can be combined to make better decisions. The AI system can help to generate a list of possible solutions, but the human expert is still needed to make the final decision.

Some tasks however like the processing of large volumes of data so that it fits to a companies values can be solely left in the hands of AI to process. (at least till the AI gets faulty) 😅

Different scenarios different concepts as to how AI Is taking over.

As AI technology continues to evolve, it will become increasingly capable of taking on tasks that are currently done by humans. However, there will always be tasks that require human judgment and creativity.

The legal and regulatory environment will also affect the best approach. For example, in some countries, there are laws that govern the use of AI in certain applications.

@Recruit @Ambassador 

Expanding on our previous chat about AI-Human teamwork, we've been exploring the incredible possibilities of AI and its relationship with humans.
So, let's dive deeper, shall we? 🌊

Imagine AI in security cameras - they're great at recognizing faces and beefing up security, but there's this flip side where they're always watching and recording our every move. It makes you feel like you're under a constant spotlight, right? That's just one of the ways AI can make us think twice.

Now, consider AI in hiring processes. Some companies use it to pick out who gets a shot at a job interview, which sounds interesting. But what if, unintentionally, it starts showing favoritism or bias based on factors like where someone's from or their background? That's a puzzle worth solving.


So, the big question we're rolling into today is this: Do we need to set some ground rules or restrictions on how we use AI?


This is no small matter; it's about making sure AI plays fair, keeps us safe, and respects our boundaries. What do you think? Should there be a laid down guideline to keep AI in check, and if so, how do we strike that delicate balance between making the most of AI's talents and avoiding its hiccups? 🤖🌐🤔",,💯 (3)

By advancing AI development, we can learn from our mistakes, iterate on existing AI systems, and ultimately find a balance between minimizing risks and maximizing benefits. This philosophy of continuous improvement not only ensures that AI remains a powerful and useful tool, but also fosters a culture of responsible innovation.

One of the main advantages of this incremental approach is that it allows researchers and developers to improve AI systems in real time, responding to challenges and problems as they arise. By identifying areas where AI systems may have unintended consequences or ethical shortcomings.

Recognizing that AI systems are a work in progress, stakeholders can come together to share ideas, best practices, and lessons learned. This collective approach to AI safety and ethics can help us grapple with the complex challenges posed by increasingly advanced AI systems, while ensuring that these powerful tools are used to improve society as a whole.

The example with security cameras is good, but if an AI can choose its favorites based on certain characteristics, I think this is already a set of problems that cannot be prevented in the creation of the development of such an AI",,💯 (2)

Any employer will choose to buy a program that will do the job much faster and better than a human, without errors, and which will cost him much less than a live specialist. Yes, this is the progress of technology and all that, but there is another side to the coin, most professions will simply cease to exist. I think this cannot be allowed.

The only exception is professions where there is a risk to human life, for example military professions. It would be cool if a tank or plane was controlled by AI instead of people.

Regarding military purposes, I was referring to those parts of the industry where people risk their lives.

Hope you all are having a great day?

Today our discussion will be focused on an important topic""Quality and Reliable Data to Empower AI."" 🤖

In today's AI-driven world, data holds the keys to transformative innovation and informed decision-making. However, the foundation of any robust AI system lies in the quality and trustworthiness of the data it's nurtured on.

To set the stage, I'd like to pose an open-ended question that invites your insights: ""What challenges and opportunities do you perceive in ensuring that the data fueling AI models is consistently of the highest quality and reliability?""

This topic is crucial in the AI landscape, given that the precision and equity of AI algorithms are linked to the quality of their training data. The implications of deploying AI with flawed or biased data are profound, ranging from inaccurate predictions to reinforcing societal disparities.

As an example, consider the role of AI in healthcare, where patient data underpins critical diagnostic tools. How can we be certain that this data is both comprehensive and devoid of biases, and genuinely mirrors our diverse populations?

It seems to me that one of the main challenges is to ensure that data quality is consistently high. After all, data can be outdated, erroneous or biases can be introduced. All of these can lead to unreliable results and even increase social inequalities.

On the other hand, the opportunities here are enormous. If we can ensure data quality, artificial intelligence can help solve a host of global problems, from accurate medical diagnosis to improving weather forecasts and manufacturing efficiency.

Of course, the example of medicine is particularly important. Here, patient data plays a key role in preserving health and saving lives. We must ensure that this data is not only comprehensive but also free of bias to ensure the best possible outcomes for all patients.

Thus, it is important to continue to develop and refine methods for collecting, processing and analyzing data to ensure the quality and reliability of the data on which artificial intelligence is built, thereby improving our lives and future.",,💯 (3)

Inclusiveness requires AI to take into account all human races and experiences. Inclusive design practices can help designers understand and address potential barriers that may unintentionally exclude people.

It is important that the system performs as it was designed and responds safely to new situations. It must provide resistance to intentional or unintentional manipulation. I think this requires audits and constant monitoring of the state of AI and its changing algorithms, a person should not lose control.Organizations should consider establishing an internal oversight body that provides oversight, insight, and guidance for the development and implementation of AI systems.

Today, let's dive into the intriguing world of ""AI in education."" This topic holds the potential to reshape how we learn and teach, making education more efficient and accessible. 📚🤖 But like any transformative technology, it brings its fair share of pros and cons. 🤔💡

On the bright side, AI in education can offer personalized learning experiences tailored to each student, helping them grasp concepts at their own pace. 🎓📊 Additionally, AI can efficiently handle administrative tasks, freeing up educators to focus more on teaching and mentoring. An example that comes to mind is the use of adaptive learning platforms like Khan Academy, which adapts content to individual student needs.

However, there are also concerns. The digital divide, for instance, can exacerbate inequalities if not addressed, as not all students have equal access to technology and the internet. 🌐💻 Furthermore, there's a worry about over-reliance on technology, potentially diminishing the crucial role of human interaction in education. 👥🔌 Take the example of AI grading systems, which, while efficient, might miss the nuances and personal touch of human feedback, leaving students wanting more.

About the lack of personalized learning in classes and the fact that students from large families lack the attention of teachers, which is why they begin to fall behind.

Perhaps soon, with the help of a built-in camera, AI will even be able to recognize non-verbal signals such as a student's facial expression while completing a task, and depending on the result of monitoring, change the level of difficulty of his program.

In the current labor market, when new information is constantly emerging, it is vital for specialists to constantly improve their skills - and this is a completely new demand in society. And from this point of view, it certainly has many advantages and will be extremely useful in the educational process. But only as an instrument of education and not its replacement, it will also not be able (at least as I see it) to replace teachers completely, and will not be able to replace the school, since the very process of socialization of children in school plays perhaps an even greater role than education itself ( I'm talking about elementary school).",,💯 (3)

The creation of music or movies using AI is not very developed yet, so I would give an example of a picture. In the last few years, the creation of images using AI has become very widespread. And these paintings can even be bought for a lot of money. But how does it relate to this? Can this be considered art? 
I think that's not exactly what people need. Of course, if you're not a fan of all this, maybe you have a couple of paintings at home that just hang on the walls for decoration, but you don't even notice them, don't think about their history. In this case, you can also have a picture created by AI. But connoisseurs are unlikely to find anything in this. After all, for such people, what the author wanted to convey is important. Your feelings, thoughts, experiences, etc. That's exactly what AI is all about. 
At the same time, the art itself is created not just to create the same picture, but to express your feelings in the process of creating it.

If you look at the situation now, then AI really helps a lot. When I can't understand how this or that thing works, I can't understand the meaning of something, then I go to look for an answer on the Internet. If I don't understand, then I go to the next site and so on until I find the answer. But with AI, everything is much simpler. I can ask a question and get an answer right away. At the same time, I can ask AI to explain it in a simpler formulation, ask to explain every word in the definition, etc. This really makes the learning process easier. But not so long ago, people had to sit in the library for hours, sorting through a lot of books to find the necessary information. Of course, the Internet has simplified all this, but AI literally gives ready-made answers to many questions.

At the same time, people will also reason less. After all, quite recently we collected information, analyzed it and drew conclusions. Such a long way to just get an answer to a question. But now AI will do it in a couple of seconds. It will just make us lazy. Yes, already now some GPT will easily write an essay or report. 
In general, AI carries a lot of utility, but it can also create a lot of new problems. Therefore, the use of AI in any field should have some boundaries. And the most important thing is that AI is first of all our assistant. Humanity should not seek to dump all its work on technology",,💯 (1)

Among the significant consequences are:

Content Recommendation: AI algorithms use user preferences and activity data to suggest movies, songs, and TV episodes on services like Netflix and Spotify, improving the user experience.

AI is capable of creating content, including songs, screenplays, and even original works of art. AI has been utilized, for instance, to compose music and come up with screenplay ideas.

AI-driven technologies have increased the effectiveness and quality of the visual effects used in movies and video games, resulting in more lifelike and engaging experiences.

This shouldn't be a cause for debate. The essence of propping up an institution in the first place is to allow individuals of great knowledge(Lectures) teach the junior ones.
I'm not saying AI would be ineffective or inefficient in this field but there would be barriers and there would ultimately be bias.

For instance, a child having depression comes into class. AI would ultimately begin teaching, but a human would call the child to his desk and begin to inquire what the problem is.
Education isn't just academical it is soo much more. Should AI choose to be a part of this structural Institution I'd rather it be subjected to record / data keeping than the action of teaching itself.",,💯 (2)

Human Touch: It's crucial to preserve the human touch and creative spirit in entertainment. While AI can assist in generating content, it should complement human creativity rather than replace it. AI tools can be used as aids to enhance the creative process rather than as sole creators.

Authenticity: Transparency is key. When AI-generated content is used, audiences should be aware of it. In cases like virtual actors, being transparent about the use of AI can help maintain authenticity and trust.

Quality Control: The entertainment industry must ensure that AI-generated content meets high standards of quality and creativity. Human oversight and curation remain essential to maintaining artistic integrity.

This function didn't always exist but with developing times it became evident that this function was a necessity.
The **compute-to-data** function allows data remain on-chain while enabling 3rd parties to perform computations on said data. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential.

Think of **compute-to-data** in the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem as a way to work on a jigsaw puzzle without revealing the whole picture to someone else. You have a puzzle, and someone else has some missing pieces. Instead of giving them your entire puzzle, you allow them to place their missing pieces in your puzzle in a secure way, and they can see only the parts that are relevant to them.

For an example, imagine you have a lot of photos that are stored on a server. You want to find all the photos with red cars. Instead of downloading all the photos to your computer and searching there, you send a special program to the server that searches for photos with red cars right where the photos are stored.

Also good metaphor with wheat and flour, but in this case, the original data remains as such and is not turned into anything else. What might be more akin is having a trained mouse that only recognizes how to count how much wheat is stored in a silo, but cannot tell its texture, strain, color, freshness etc. So the mouse (algo) goes in and can only extract volume info back to report. If we were to keep this metaphor.",,

Know how I keep going  on about how there's a lot to Ocean to deep dive into aside from data markets and compute-to-data?
OPF just dropped Predictoor last week, and well, considering $OCEAN is also classified as an AI token, many of you might be wondering how this all ties together. Models, data predictions, AI....
Answers on Thursday, set your calendars if you can to understand what this is all about.

Ocean Predictoor is a dapp and a stack for prediction feeds. It has accountability for accuracy, via staking. It’s globally distributed and censorship-resistant, by being on-chain.

Briefly, how it works. Now the service is working on predicting the price of cryptocurrencies according to the following principle: a group of people “predictors” make their forecast for the change in the price of a certain crypto asset for the next 5 minutes, and they also bet their money on this prediction, in the form of tokens. The amount of money bet correlates with the confidence in the prediction. If the forecast is correct, the predictor earn money; if not, he loses money. The bet of the predictors who gave an incorrect forecast is divided among the predictors who gave the correct forecast. This ensures accountability for the predictors, which is a very important factor and will definitely affect the accuracy of the predictions.

The second side is traders. They can buy a subscription to predictions and use them in their trading strategies. The trader simply pays money for a subscription and receives an aggregate prediction for a particular asset, which he can use during the next period of time (5 minutes) while the forecast is relevant.

Now this works with the price of cryptocurrencies in testnet mode, but this is just the beginning. Getting accurate forecasts is very important, imagine for example in the case of a weather forecast: you can receive a weather forecast not from one meteorological center, which is not responsible for its forecast, but get a prediction based on information from several meteorological centers, which are financially responsible for their prediction.

What do you think about such a model for making predictions, in what areas could humanity benefit now using such a model?",,💯 (2)

A model of this kind can be useful because it can improve forecasting in a variety of areas where accuracy is important.

This authority determines who can access, modify, and use the data. If the central database or authority experiences a breach, outage, or corruption, it can have severe consequences for data availability and security.

In a decentralized system, data ownership and control are distributed among multiple participants. No single entity has exclusive authority over the data. Decentralized data systems are more resilient to failures and attacks. This setup of data spread across multiple nodes makes it difficult for a single point of failure to disrupt data availability.

Ocean Protocol being a blockchain-based ecosystem addresses data centralization and promotes data decentralization in many ways. 
With the provision of a **MARKETPLACE** data providers can publish their data assets how they see fit. This allows individuals and organizations to share their data with others in a decentralized manner, reducing the reliance on centralized data repositories.

It is true that checking and assurance is not easy with the huge amount of data collected. Or rather, it's not feasible. However, I think data providers could be encouraged to do their own due diligence before sharing their data, perhaps with a pre-announcement, and I know this is not easy either.",,❤️ (2)

First, accountability ensures that the predictions made by AI systems can be traced back to their sources and that the responsible parties can be held answerable for their actions¹. This is especially important in the context of AI governance, where decisions made by AI systems can have a significant impact on people's lives. By establishing accountability, we can ensure that AI systems are fair, transparent, and aligned with societal values.

Second, accuracy is emphasized in prediction feeds to ensure that the predictions provided are reliable and trustworthy. Accurate predictions enable individuals and organizations to make informed decisions based on reliable information. For example, accurate weather forecasts help people plan outdoor activities or take necessary precautions during extreme weather conditions. In the case of financial predictions, accuracy is crucial for investors and businesses to make sound investment decisions.

Overall, accountability and accuracy are emphasized in prediction feeds to promote transparency, fairness, and reliability in AI systems, enabling individuals and organizations to make well-informed decisions based on trustworthy predictions.",,💯 (2)

Prediction feeds emphasize accuracy and accountability because they play a critical role in decision-making across various domains such as finance, weather, and real estate. Inaccurate predictions can lead to significant harm for users who rely on these forecasts, potentially resulting in financial losses or poor decision-making. Accountability mechanisms, such as staking or rewarding correct predictors, help ensure that those providing predictions have an incentive to provide accurate information, which, in turn, enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of the predictions.",,"💯 (4),✅ (1)"

Slow transaction processing can be a bit of a headache. It's like trying to catch a fast train with a slow ticket system – it might not work as smoothly as we'd like.
So, while blockchain brings transparency and trust to prediction platforms, it needs some fine-tuning in terms of speed and handling a large number of predictions to truly shine in fast-paced markets.",,

This is especially important in the field of forecasting, where the accuracy and integrity of the data are of great importance.
According to another, the blockchain will provide insight and trust to the forecasting platform for the decentralization of the system. I respect that as people know that this forecast was inspired by a great number of people in the Duma, then before such a forecast, you should trust the forecast of any company that can, for the sake of these and other manipulations, produce such a forecast as it is required",,

Then I studied and worked in this field, although I didn't have extensive knowledge, but I was interested in it. At that point I came to the conclusion that it was very difficult for me to create a model that would predict accurately. But then I came up with a hypothesis: the forecasts collected from different forecasters will be close to reality on average. But I never managed to test this hypothesis. 

And now I see how Ocean Protocol has actually tested it, at least created such an algorithm that is able to test the hypothesis that I set when I set it.

I think this approach to forecasting and model building will be successful because one forecaster without an incentive can do little, while hundreds of forecasters with an incentive can create a more perfect model, even though they will be independent of each other. 

Blockchain is the only technology that can recreate an incentive-based system for developing predictive models. 

I can't say what the drawbacks are yet because I can't see the results of the implementation, but one drawback is probably there: perhaps the independence of the agents will inhibit model development because they won't be able to coordinate and solve a common problem together, but this is just a guess, and this drawback can be easily fixed.",,

And a lot of social surveys are conducted on this topic. But can we trust such polls and be sure they are right? Perhaps these politicians did not want to reveal the real picture and they are slightly improving the data in their favor. Or, on the contrary, someone wants to undermine the credibility of those in power and shows results worse than they actually are. In general, I think you understand what I mean.

Possible profit for people who use the predictor correctly, additional profit for people who are really good at what they do (for example, now it is trading). More accurate forecasts and their statistics.

Cons or what I don't like:

It seems to me unrealistic to use Predictor in such areas as weather forecasting if ordinary people will be able to vote. Each vote will have little effectiveness, because people who are not experts have no idea how to predict the weather. In addition, there are sudden rains that are almost impossible to predict in advance. This could be solved by allowing only experts to vote, but then the whole point of the predictor would be lost. And there are quite a few such industries, as it requires scientific research, radar images, and other things that cannot be obtained at home on a computer",,

And Predictoor is set up in such a way that it itself involves the development of AI/ML models, as it uses the concept of disparate agents. Anyone can become a predictor and create their own prediction model, but only those who are right and accurate in their predictions can make money. Hence, it automatically follows that in order to get a constant income it is necessary not only to create a forecasting model, but also to improve it constantly. Thus, if the forecaster is wrong, firstly, he loses his stake in Ocean tokens, and secondly, he does not earn part of the money from subscriptions made by users (traders), it turns out that in order to generate income the forecaster needs to constantly improve his model. 

Eventually, after a sufficiently long time, the accuracy of aggregate forecasts will increase - this is a consequence of the improvement of individual models by all forecasters.",,💯 (4)

For example, Chainlink is a network of decentralized oracles. And there are special mechanisms that allow you to evaluate the work of this or that oracle. And in case of poor performance, he may receive some financial sanctions. Therefore, the information must be correct, and the work of the oracle must be clear. Only in this case it is possible to receive rewards. The predictor platform is similar to Chainlink in this regard.

However, they differ in the type of data they provide and the way they evaluate their data providers. Chainlink provides external data from various sources, such as web APIs, market data providers, or IoT devices, and uses a reputation system to evaluate its oracles’ performance. Predictoor provides prediction data from users’ opinions or analysis and uses a staking system to hold its predictoors accountable.

I think both have their advantages depending on the needs. As for the question of how Predictoor can become Chainlink 2.0, I think Predictoor can become a better alternative to Chainlink and it is only a matter of time. Why do I think so?

Chainlink 2.0 also uses a variety of measures to ensure that its data feeds are tamper-proof. These include
Data provenance: Chainlink 2.0 keeps track of the provenance of all data, allowing data to be traced back to where they originated. This detects any attempts at data manipulation.
Aggregating data: To ensure data is accurate and consistent, Chainlink 2.0 aggregates data from multiple sources.
Predictoor and Chainlink 2.0 are both secure and tamper-resistant oracle networks that can be used to provide data feeds to smart contracts. But the two platforms have several key differences.

Nice question!

I think the main purpose of the Ocean Shipyard grant program is to support and fund projects that are building Web3 applications on Ocean Protocol

In simple terms, it's about giving financial support to people with great ideas to build things on the Ocean Protocol platform. These projects should use Ocean technology or the OCEAN token, be open source, have skilled teams, and a clear use case. 

But I would like to add that when studying this issue. I think it would be interesting for recruit to pay attention to those projects that have already been built under this program.

There are several conditions to be met to receive this support funds as your project to be built should be an open-source Web3 solution on Ocean Protocol it should also be capable of making valuable data available, build innovations and create value for the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem. 

Just like @KreigDk 🔥 mentioned a key focus on this topic would be the projects that have successfully launched utilizing the Ocean Shipyard grant.
One such project that I'm quite happy to see every single time is Brainstem 🧠.

Maybe it's because I am health inclined but I do favor Brainstem. Heath data is of high value in any market and often times these health professionals are sworn under oath to not reveal any of these data without the consent of the consumers or clients.
So making a wearable portkey device that has been signed under law and can supply such heath data statistics is a huge data inflow for Ocean Protocol at large 💯.

All in all the Shipyard grant is an amazing approach to effectively supporting the community at large with beautiful ideas that they can produce as long as it satisfies the above mentioned conditions.",,💯 (4)

A system that rewards quality data providers should encourage them to provide only such data so that bad data is at the bottom of the ranking.
Before buying data, a person pays attention to the number of sales, and if it is high, then most likely there will be no doubt about the quality, but what if you are interested in data where there are no sales yet? You can become the first buyer at your own risk, but it doesn't guarantee that you'll get what you expect.

**Today is Thursday, and it's a great day to discuss the concept of using data as a financial asset.**

*Ocean Protocol was founded with the goal of creating a data economy where people own the data and can sell or buy it, for example to develop artificial intelligence models, conduct research, or create algorithms.

Tokenization of data assets opens up the possibility of using data as collateral in DeFi. This means we can connect data to the expanding DeFi space. Data can be useful not only for the traditional use case of trading and risk models, but also as a first-class financial citizen: data itself can be used as a collateral asset. (And more generally, data can be securitized.)

For an open data economy, we can and should use the tools of the token economy. Tokens themselves are a key tool. Datatokens naturally leverages existing cryptographic infrastructure for tokens, such as wallets.Datatokens are like APIs for transferring data (oceans) within the entire Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. This means that data tokens can naturally use all the tools and protocols that are emerging in DeFi.
In other words: with datatokens, the DeFi ecosystem gets a whole new class of tokens to work with. Datatokens can live side by side with existing tokens such as ETH and BTC, as well as thousands of other tokens, and be used in existing and future DeFi applications.

I like answer @Feno . But I would like to add

Using data as a financial asset is possible because data can have value, much like other assets. To make this happen, we need to:

Recognize the value of data: Understand that data can be valuable for making decisions, predictions, and more.

Tokenize data: Create digital tokens that represent data, making it tradable, similar to stocks or bonds.

Define ownership rights: Establish who owns the data and what rights come with ownership to enable trading and use in financial transactions.

Ensure data security: Protect data from breaches or tampering to maintain its value.

To do this, it must be converted into ERC-20 or ERC-721 NFT tokens, which will allow the ownership and transfer or sale of the asset to be backed by Ocean Protocol technology.

This solution is well suited for music creators, artists, or owners of various assets who want to turn their data into an asset and assign ownership to it.

I think we are just at the beginning of the journey and there is no limit with the use of this technology. With the development of cryptography and Ocean Protocol, it is important that the world is ready to keep up with the technology - and to build a series of laws and legal regulations in an international format to control and move from the usual documentation and bureaucracy to digitalize assets and transfer them through blockchain.

For example: buying a car through blockchain where the ownership data is transferred to the other owner through NFTs (documentation in digital form) this applies to the transfer of ownership of real estate or any other assets where the sale or transfer takes a lot of time, so it is important to develop a legal rule in line with the development of technology.

Artificial intelligence continues to actively develop and find a use in various industries. I think that the moment when AI will be fully integrated into the production chain is just a matter of time and the speed of AI training. After all, the production chain is a rigid algorithm where there is no place for philosophy, which means that AI may well be integrated into this chain.
If the work of any industry involves human interaction and or requires intuition, then the introduction of AI will be more difficult here, and even then, if there is high-quality data, I think that sooner or later AI will be able to penetrate there too.

Among the risks, as I said earlier, I still see only two main risks:
1. Total unemployment, any intellectual work will be performed by artificial intelligence faster, cheaper and better than a human, if there is high-quality data regarding which AI makes certain decisions.
2. Skynet - I think everyone understood what I mean :))

Ocean protocol can significantly influence the development of AI in that its tools are aimed at ensuring the quality of data that can be sold, and as we know, data quality is one of the main factors on which the development of AI depends.

I think AI models are already being implemented in all areas of our lives at the moment.
Large companies are actively implementing to increase production and replace the number of workers, increasing productivity and reducing the cost of production.

For the development of AI technologies in the future, we need libraries of data to which different AIs can connect and learn to create new solutions.

With the development of AI and its implementation in production - there is a risk of unemployment, because a properly trained algorithm can replace a number of professions in life and production.

Ocean Protocol - is already making great contributions to machine learning and training AI models on data. We can see these solutions in the Ocean Protocol ecosystem and in the latest Predictoor product.

As for artificial intelligence, it has now reached unprecedented heights compared to previous years, but in my opinion this level is not sufficient even to outstrip human intelligence - it makes mistakes typical of robots, I think that this problem will be solved soon. including thanks to self-learning artificial intelligence. As for production chains, it is already possible to introduce AI into certain processes; now these processes are simple and do not require multifactor control. Such processes already exist, although in order to participate in them, AI underwent multi-level training with the help of people. Perhaps in the future this will become a widespread solution, but now it is labor-intensive to train and implement such intelligence. AI in the future will develop in leaps and bounds in geometric progression thanks to current technologies, this will make people’s lives much easier, so investing in projects will occur with particular enthusiasm. What risks are involved? I don't think there will be a robot uprising in the near future😁. In my opinion, the main risk is the displacement of people from jobs, which can lead to unemployment and a complete change in the labor market. But this risk is small and not scary, since with the systematic development of AI, humanity will also change. Such a negative unemployment scenario is only possible with the very rapid and dramatic development of artificial intelligence.

Also keep in mind that we all can't know everything and there may be mistakes and inaccuracies in our answers, I encourage you to not be afraid to answer and speak in your own words. **

|| With all the hype about AI, one thing has come to forefront: rights of the owners of the data (text, images, audio, videos, etc) that are being used to train the AI models. Do you think there is a way for Ocean Protocol to be used to not only protect owner rights, as well as to track who used said data? Why (or why not?) How? ||

Ocean Protocol can potentially help protect the rights of data owners through decentralized data markets. Here, data owners can list their data sets, set prices, and specify terms of use. This ensures that data owners can control who accesses their data and for what compensation. Ocean Protocol uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to manage access to data. This means that when someone wants to use the data set, they will have to execute a smart contract that will grant them access. These contracts can be transparent and unchangeable, ensuring that the terms of data use are clear and enforceable.

I am happy to participate in this discussion on how the Ocean Protocol can be used to protect the rights of data owners.

I believe there are several ways the Ocean Protocol can be used for this purpose.

First, the Ocean Protocol can be used to create a data registry. This registry could list all data that is collected, used, or shared.This would allow data owners to know where their data is and who has access to it.

Second, the Ocean Protocol can be used to define standards for data collection and use. These standards could ensure that data owners are informed of their data collection and that they have the right to control how their data is used.

Third, the Ocean Protocol can be used to create tools and resources to help dataowners protect their rights. These tools could include software to track data usage and resources to help data owners enforce their rights.

In terms of the question of who has used specific data, the Ocean Protocol could be used to track data usage. This could be done by adding metadata to data that indicates who used the data and how it was used.


Finally, I have worked with the Ternoa project in the past which offers wealth transfer and digital will services. which documents are included in an NFT and save. This allows the data to remain authentic until the recipient is accessed using a password that only he and the designer know. Ocean Protocol can then decide to set up a similar system or collaborate with Ternoa to use this service to guarantee the authenticity of the data. 

However, there are a few challenges to using the Ocean Protocol in this way.One challenge is that the Ocean Protocol is still under development. It may take time to implement the features necessary to protect the rights of data owners.

Thank you for your attention.",,💯 (1)

Well, it's Monday and I want to open this week with a discussion on artificial intelligence in coding. It's no secret that there are many extensions for VSCode that are equipped with AI assistants. Now people who don't understand anything in code can write simple python code, and not just write it, but learn terms, functions, and correct errors. Does this mean that in the foreseeable future it will be to create full-fledged projects (for example, games) with the help of AI, or will its role remain an assistant?",,💯 (6)

Again, let's take the simplest game in the code - chess. Artificial intelligences are divided into weak ones (which implement certain algorithms, like NPCs in games) and strong ones (which train themselves based on their own mistakes). So, until recently, chess had the strongest AI StockFish, which implemented all the algorithms of all games in history. All the world chess champions have lost to him, but recently a new artificial intelligence has appeared, whose name is AlphaZero. Chess algorithms were not introduced into him, but he could learn to play by himself. After only 4 hours, Alpha Zero wins the match against StockFish, after which she never lost to him again. No one expected this. So, going back to @vladpaper  answer. I want to say that most likely we will not have time to notice how artificial intelligence will start developing games. Many of us did not follow OpenAI before the advent of ChatGPT. My opinion is that super-artificial intelligence will appear as unexpectedly for the world as AlphaZero for the world of chess👀",,💯 (3)

But writing these reward functions can be complex and time-consuming. However, this latest breakthrough can reportedly outperform human-written algorithms 80% of the time in tests, which could significantly accelerate the timeline for many innovations in robotics.

Convenient payment option in Matic with built-in bridge, interaction is very easy, great preference for low commissions.

This solution helps to easily store data, without lengthy registrations and the user will be guaranteed safe and secure storage of his information in a decentralized storage, which can not be said about the usual web2 platforms, which are prone to hacking and the data users have access to the owners of the platform.

That's why Ocean Uploader takes the lead and makes it possible to store data safely while maintaining confidentiality.",,💯 (4)

Transactions between legal entities often involve prepayment for goods or some services, and with the help of such a register, it would be possible to track how reliable the partner to whom you are going to pay money is. For example, if we see that the number of employees has been decreasing over recent periods, for example, years, as well as the cash balance, if the company has arrears in paying taxes, then these are obvious factors that make it clear that a transaction with them is at risk.

I mean that each student must pass some kind of test, according to the result of which he will be included in one or another group of students.

Good afternoon. I wish you all a good and productive week. And I have prepared a question for you related to AI.
 
I think you've all noticed how AI is becoming an increasingly large part of our lives and is already being used in many areas. And now AI is already creating pictures, writing songs, AI has even created a horror movie. 
And in 2022 , a man won an artist contest with a painting created through Midjourney . Many people did not agree with this, but the man himself believes that he is the author of the picture, because he spent a lot of effort to create the perfect request. 
 
 Do you think such things can be considered art or not, and why?

I think artificial intelligence can write a good movie script, but it might need some human guidance and feedback along the way. AI can generate creative and original content, such as character descriptions, plot points, location descriptions and dialogue, based on the input and the genre of the movie. However, AI might not be able to capture the emotional nuances and subtleties that make a movie script engaging and compelling for the audience. AI might also struggle to maintain coherence and consistency throughout the script, especially if it is a long one.

Therefore, I think AI can be a useful co-writer or assistant for human writers, who can edit, rewrite and improve the AI-generated script. Human writers can also provide feedback and suggestions to the AI, so that it can learn from its mistakes and improve its writing skills. AI can also help human writers overcome writer’s block, generate new ideas and explore different possibilities.

There are already some examples of AI tools that can help generate rough film and stage scripts, such as Dramatron1, DeepStory2 and Shortly AI3. These tools use advanced natural language models, such as GPT-3, to produce human-like writing based on the user’s input. However, these tools are not perfect and still need human intervention and supervision to produce a high-quality script.

So, to answer your question, I think AI can write a good movie script, but it cannot do it alone. It needs human collaboration and creativity to make it happen. Maybe in the future, AI will be able to write a movie script that can touch our emotions and make us laugh or cry, but for now, it still needs our help. 😊",,💯 (3)

However, as you mentioned, only a small fraction of enterprises in the world use AI today. Why is that?
One of the main challenges is the lack of access to high-quality and relevant data. Data is the fuel for AI, but it is often siloed, fragmented, or inaccessible due to privacy, security, or legal issues. Without data, AI cannot learn, improve, or generate value.

This is where Ocean Protocol comes in. Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange protocol that enables individuals and organizations to share, monetize, and consume data in a secure and transparent manner. By using blockchain technology, Ocean Protocol allows for the creation of data marketplaces that connect data providers with consumers who need that data for various purposes.

Ocean Protocol can help accelerate the implementation of AI in several ways:

- It can increase the supply and demand of data by incentivizing data owners to publish their data and rewarding data consumers for using it.
- It can lower the barriers and costs of accessing data by using data tokens that grant permission to access specific data sets.
- It can protect the privacy and security of data by using encryption, access control, and compute-to-data techniques that allow for remote computation without exposing the raw data.

By using Ocean Protocol, enterprises can unlock the potential of their data and leverage AI to gain insights, optimize processes, enhance products, and create new value streams.",,

Subsequently, the AI can become smarter and create the tyranny of artificial intelligence. We hope to avoid such a scenario. As for the second question, you can sell the data, or you can create a separate platform based on the ocean, where users can train AI for an additional fee.",,💯 (2)

Ocean Protocol enables secure sharing of large datasets, which can be used to train AI models more effectively. For example, a healthcare organization can share anonymized patient data securely for developing AI models that predict diseases.

2. **Data Monetization**: Data providers can monetize their data while maintaining privacy and control. This incentivizes the collection and curation of high-quality data, which is essential for training robust AI models. For instance, a retail company could monetize its customer behavior data, allowing AI developers to create more personalized recommendation systems.

3. **Decentralized Data Marketplaces**: Ocean Protocol's decentralized approach facilitates the creation of data marketplaces. AI developers can access diverse datasets from these marketplaces, enhancing the generalizability and accuracy of their models. An example would be an AI firm accessing a global marketplace for diverse image datasets to train a more inclusive facial recognition system.

4. **Privacy-Preserving AI**: By using Ocean Protocol's secure data sharing mechanisms, AI models can be trained on sensitive data without compromising privacy. This is particularly useful in fields like finance or healthcare, where data sensitivity is high. For example, banks can collaborate to train fraud detection AI without exposing individual customer data.

5. **Collaborative AI Research**: Researchers and organizations can collaborate on AI projects without relinquishing data ownership. This fosters innovation and accelerates AI development. A collaborative project could involve multiple universities sharing research data to develop an AI model for climate change prediction.

6. **Data Validation and Curation**: Ocean Protocol can help in validating and curating datasets for AI use, ensuring the quality and relevance of the data used for training.",,"💯 (1),🤔 (2)"

•Blockchain is decentralized and distributed ledger technology that enables secure and transparent record keeping of transactions across a network of computers.

• As the word predictor implies. 

• Predictor is not a standard term in Blockchain,but if referring to a predictive model, It could actually relate to tools that attempt to forecast future events trends and behaviour based on historical data and it might be used for many purposes,such as market trends.

• It relates to the consensus mechanism, which ensures that all nodes are in a blockchain network with an agreement.

•  So why did the team decide to choose blockchain, is for the Project where features align with the goals of security,decentralization,and transparency,
because blocks are linked together using cryptography hashes, forming a chain that provides an immutable and transparency history of transactions. 

• Blockchain are mostly used in industries like finance for cryptocurrency transactions,which supply chain management for choosing blockchain which depends on the requirements and objectives of the project.

• The risk of using predictor on blockchain comes with excess challenges, such as Data privacy, Accuracy concerns, scalability, decentralisation challenges, smart contract vulnerabilities and adversarial attacks etc.

So to use predictor on a blockchain, it is very necessary to carefully assess these risks.

• Predictors can help build trust among people or stakeholders through clear communication regarding the use of predictors.",,

It is also interesting to know that the predictor uses the Oasis Sapphire privacy conserving the EVM chain.
The feed can be in binary irrespective of change in time series.
It has responsibility for accuracy via staking.
It is distributed as well as censorship resistance by being on a chain.

Hello everyone!

Apologies for the late question, but here's a little thought-provoking query before bedtime: today on Twitter(x), Ocean Protocol posted an intriguing tweet about the impact of artificial intelligence (#AI) on our lives.

💹 The AI market is estimated to be worth $136.6 billion in 2022.
👾 The current level of AI adoption stands at 35%.
🌍 Global GDP is expected to grow by $15.7 trillion by 2030.

https://x.com/oceanprotocol/status/1726632462262927655?s=20

Impressive numbers, aren't they? Personally, I've noticed how I interact more and more with artificial intelligence every day and how it makes life easier in certain areas.

So here's a question for you: what do you think the figures I mentioned will look like by 2035, and how closely intertwined do you believe our lives will become with AI? Do you see it as a threat or as a beneficial friend? Share your thoughts! 🤖🌟

The process from surprise has become a working and routine rhythm and is becoming more and more embedded in our lives, I assume that now without it in some way it will become more difficult to perform certain tasks, especially when it comes to time, now it is becoming part of our technological world and the more routine tasks can be covered by artificial intelligence, the more attached we will be to it in the future.

But as for the latest news about AI in the future, I think you have already seen the news or know that Sam Altman (co-founder and CEO of OpenAI) was fired one day by the board of directors allegedly for ""not being honest"" and because of internal disagreements about the future of artificial intelligence (so said in the media).

This would involve converting the raw data into datatokens, which could then be traded or sold, providing a potential revenue stream to support the observatory’s operations.
    •    Decentralized Data Sharing and Management: By utilizing Ocean Protocol’s infrastructure, the data from LoVe Ocean could be managed and shared in a decentralized manner. This approach would enhance data security and accessibility, allowing researchers and other interested parties worldwide to access and utilize the data more efficiently.
    •    Collaborative Research and Development: The integration would facilitate collaborative research by enabling easier and more transparent data sharing. Researchers could use Ocean Protocol’s marketplace to access LoVe Ocean’s data, fostering a more collaborative and open scientific community.

First of all, sorry for pretty late time for this daily question.  This week's topic is Ocean Protocol ecosystem projects. Today, while preparing the content, I studied some projects and I really liked one called Brainstem Health. In short, this is a technology whose task is to automate the collection and transmission of data on the client’s health status to his attending physician or to a company that conducts research. They have a bracelet that constantly records the patient’s condition.  Using Ocean Protocol tools, data is constantly sent to its destination. In some cases, the patient can receive rewards for their data.  Compute-OF-Data is used, so that privacy is reliably protected. For me, this is a very interesting project that has every chance of taking medicine to the next level.

2. Compute Request: Potential users who wish to process this data make compute requests, specifying what specific computations or analyses they need to perform.

3. Secure Computation on User's Side: Instead of transferring the data, the computation process itself occurs on the user's side (data owner). The data owner provides the computation in a secure environment, ensuring that the data remains confidential.

4. Results Provision: After the computation is complete, the user receives only the results of the analysis or computation, not the raw input data. This allows the utilization of the data without disclosing it to the user.

In my opinion the best strategy is a mix of long term lock (4 years), short term (1/2 years) but also the use of psdnOCEAN of our friend from Poseidon (ex H20).

You can get max exposure in VeOcean as well as keeping it liquid. Maybe rotate the reward from DF to psdnOCEAN could also be an interesting strategy. 

The only limitation right now is that to compound rewards and be very active in updating the lock or allocate for the active reward is requiring too much fee cost compared to the value of the staked Ocean, probably that’s a widespread issue.

**Hi Everyone** 👋🏻 
Good Morning 🌄 Sailors!

💡 Don't know how many of you know about solve.care, have been following this project for some time now.
📲 https://solve.care/about/

So,  this project and Ocean Protocol, both blockchain-based platforms, excel in distinct areas – Solve.care in healthcare, and Ocean Protocol with a broader domain focus. Using $SOLVE and $OCEAN tokens respectively, they enable data monetization and consumption.

Both platforms allow data tokenization, but Ocean introduces data NFTs for intellectual property protection. They share a commitment to data security through encryption and blockchain, with Ocean's unique feature, compute-to-data, ensuring data control for providers.

In partnerships, Solve.care collaborates with healthcare giants like Boehringer Ingelheim, while Ocean Protocol extends to companies like Roche.

💥 **So Now Am Asking:**

There is an option to create a game platform completely based on Ocean, then projects creating games on this platform will be able to buy data from their players (data stored by the game platform), so there will be a market of game data, users can earn just a game, literally their experience will cost money. And game projects will be able to improve the game.",,💯 (2)

Hey guys 👋🏿 

So, as Ocean Protocol sets sail through uncharted waters in the blockchain space, facing a mix of challenges and opportunities along the way. There’s this amazing chance to change how we own data, making valuable information more accessible to everyone, creating new ways to use data in healthcare, finance, AI, and more! Plus, it’s about building a cool community that cares about fair and ethical data use.
But, there’s a flip side. We’ve got hurdles, like getting more people on board while keeping data safe and playing nice with rules and privacy.

So, for today, let's dive into what lies ahead for Ocean Protocol—what it could achieve and the bumps it might hit on its journey.",,💯 (1)

Indeed, the path laid out by Ocean is quite thorny and laborious, because for most people data is just data, it is somewhere on servers or on their computers and is commonplace for everyone. But in fact, data is nothing but a resource that is used to create almost everything we use. Data can be used to create algorithms, artificial intelligence, to understand human behavior, to analyze politics, finance, and especially to make new discoveries. Therefore, the main challenge is to popularize data science and explain complex concepts to people in simple words. The end-user should understand why he needs Ocean and what is or can be built on its basis, he should also understand what benefits he can get, using specific examples and projects. 

I think eventually Ocean will reach the point where it will be able to attract the mass public to the project, the only question is what will be that point: maybe some event in the world or a unique project based on Ocean, which will become popular and very popular, or maybe something that we can not even imagine yet.",,💯 (2)

I believe the strength of Ocean Protocol is mainly in security , availability and monetization of data.
Also Ocean is keeping up with the trends and incorporating AI into its new products, which makes the work much more convenient.

The future is the Meta universe and new technologies, so it would be nice for developers to continue to develop AI, support their products and open up new possibilities.

Of course, the community is always at the head of the project, but as a rule, the community consists of different groups of people with different interests. One group strives to develop the protocol, another engages in attracting new members and managing the project's recognition, and the third interacts with all the others. We are all part of the community and belong to the same group, and it is this division into groups that makes us effective.

As we all recognize, Ocean Protocol stands as an innovative decentralized platform reshaping the landscape of data ownership, privacy, and accessibility. It provides an empowering avenue for individuals and businesses to securely and efficiently monetize their data, marking a significant shift in how we perceive and utilize information.

Today, I propose we delve into three intriguing ways to earn on Ocean Protocol: the Data Challenge, Stake Ocean, and Predict & Trade. These avenues promise interesting possibilities, and discussing them will surely bring clarity to our understanding of the platform's earning potentials.",,💯 (4)

Before, no one could think that AI would appear, after its appearance, it caused a big wave of hype, because AI became useful for humans. Now it is able to solve basic human problems and I think it is the best innovation that should be developed further.

If we take Chat GPT, Bard as an example, these are already good tools for humans, I often ask GPT about what I don't know about this world and often get correct information.

About Ocean, the developers are absolute geniuses for starting to use AI not just for chatting but to solve real problems, introducing AI into their ecosystem is definitely not a mistake on the part of the Ocean team, I expect Ocean to reach new heights in this area in 2024. This year's results are great, what was at the beginning of the year and what is now is a huge gap.

AI is evolving every year and every day and I believe Ocean Protocol is moving in the right direction, if we look at the speculation on the price, Ocean's price will increase by at least 200% in the coming years, this is not just numbers from the air, Ocean is a real project that solves real problems in the data economy. :ocean: ❤️",,

Hi sailors, today I want to talk to you about Data Farming

As you know, Data Farming is an Ocean Protocol incentive program that rewards OCEAN users for blocking OCEAN, curating data or making predictions . It is divided into two streams: passive and active. Each stream has 50% of the budget. The passive stream allows you to earn passively, while the active stream requires more participation. It has several sub streams, each with their own activities.
Which type of DF is more suitable for you and why ? If you are more in favor of the active type, which sub streams do you prefer ?",,
Ocean Protocol - ECOSYSTEM - 🪢︱treasure-hunter [1113013155514290228],961181510357123092,abdulmazid_,12/28/2023 5:16 PM,"I dont understand properly. But i will try to answer. Data Farming is indeed a fascinating aspect of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. Choosing between passive and active streams depends on your preferences and level of engagement.
If you prefer a more hands-off approach and want to earn rewards passively, the Passive DF stream might be suitable for you. By locking OCEAN for veOCEAN, you can earn rewards in proportion to your veOCEAN holdings. It's a straightforward way to benefit from the program without active involvement. so i prefer Passive DF",,💯 (2)

2. **Template Predictoor Bots**: Predictoors can graduate to building and deploying Python ""Template Predictoor bots"" (agents) that submit predictions every 5 minutes. This allows predictoors to potentially generate revenue from making accurate predictions.

3. **Template Trader Bots**: Traders can build and deploy Python ""Template Trader bots"" (agents) that grab the latest prediction every 5 minutes and trade using that prediction. This enables traders to potentially make money from buying predictions.

4. **Oasis Sapphire Chain**: The Predictoor feed contracts are deployed on the Oasis Sapphire chain. There is one contract for each {pair, exchange, timescale} combination, such as {ETH/USDT, Binance, 5m}.

5. **Smart Contracts**: There is one Predictoor contract for each prediction feed at each exchange/timescale. Each contract is an Ocean datatoken contract with a new template for prediction feeds. It implements ERC20, Ocean, and Predictoor-specific behavior.",,💯 (2)

It's a wonderful day to explore the idea of treating data as a financial asset.

Ocean Protocol was founded with the vision of creating a data economy where individuals own data and can buy and sell it. This can be particularly useful for tasks such as developing artificial intelligence models, conducting research, or creating algorithms. However, consider the idea that data has even greater potential - it can serve as a financial asset, paving the way for the creation of an entire decentralized finance system where data plays a role similar to that of ETH or other cryptocurrencies.

So I ask the following questions: How can such a transformation be achieved? What are the prerequisites for using data as a financial asset?",,💯 (1)

UTU's vision is to make the internet a safer, more trusted place to gather, share, work, and trade. Fees for software development and UTU API usage will be funded by the Ocean Protocol Foundation, and the bulk of the work will be completed by Q4 2021.",,

Press release:
<https://t.co/B8hjzkR8jS>

Grants are up to $50K worth of OCEAN, with funding rounds following a monthly cadence. 

Teams that keep delivering may get grants every month. 
New teams get a special earmark, so they don’t have to compete against existing teams.

“We live in a digital economy, a data economy. But it’s closed. This generous funding is how we kickstart an open Web3 data economy, to democratize access to data and its benefits.” - @trentmc0, co-founder of Ocean Protocol <https://t.co/EGARXkMxzP>

The formula that stands behind the $140 million USD sum for grants is: 1.41B OCEAN * 51% * ¼ , where 1.41B is the total OCEAN supply, 51% is the percentage of the overall OCEAN token supply dedicated to Network Rewards.

""Data - when openly, transparently exploited, can be extremely powerful and valuable.""

Ocean founder @BrucePon discussed how the confluence of #blockchain, #AI, and #data can kickstart the New Data Economy at the #GitexGlobal conference at @Dubai today 🌊 
Highlights below!

Today, the world’s leading companies are data-centric, and currently, up to 90% of a company’s value relies on its data and IP. The key to unlocking this is blockchain technology which allows for secure provenance of data. However, there are barriers to its monetization.

Right now, there is a disconnect between data consumers and providers of data. With the lack of incentive to share, a valuable resource for our knowledge economy is under-utilized. Ocean’s works to allow for the sharing and monetization of data in a privacy-preserving fashion.

The partnership will focus on kickstarting identity verification in the #OceanMarket. 

By combining Fractal's Protocol-based Data Provisioning Incentivization with Ocean’s privacy-preserving Compute-to-Data feature and Ocean Market for data, users can take ownership of their data and monetize it themselves.

(2) Quadratic Voting will not be deployed for Round 11 

Join the OceanDAO Governance Evolution Call today @ 4PM GMT and share your ideas on how to further grow the program: https://t.co/OewXheNYLP https://t.co/yFc0sBNcH9

(1) Nurturing the growing community of our monthly grants program is a core pillar. Thus, as of Round 11 we are introducing OceanDAO Stewards, who will meet with grantees before the proposal deadline, to provide guidance towards ROI > 1. Stewards will also be in charge with vetting teams to be eligible for higher-level rewards. A >50% vote by all stewards in multisig is needed to access the higher funds.

(2) Quadratic Voting remains a key deliverable for @OceanDAO_, however we will continue working and improving it, to avoid the following:
 
- Sybil attack
- An orchestrated attack
- Become a central authority in grant-voting outcomes
- Fracture voter & grantee participation

Let's take a dive into what they aim to accomplish 👇

VORN envisions integrating the Ocean wallet into their app and enable the trading of VORN member bio-metric and spatial data on the Ocean marketplace while also utilizing Ocean's compute-to-data offering for third party research.

Problems to solve: 

🚩 Promoting user-exclusive data control rights 
🚩 Lack of marketplaces where data has value and can be securely exchanged

Grant deliverables: 

✅ Bio-metric data measurement
✅ Data cleaning and analysis
✅ Data set collection for professional and semi-professional athletes
✅ Ocean Wallet integration into VORN App

Access details here: https://t.co/XarUBFaelQ

As the name suggests, Disrupt MLS aims to disrupt the centralization of homebuyer inventory data on the MLS. The project will seek to gain traction in markets where there is no centralized MLS.

Problems to solve:

🚩 Cut out the realtors, traditional MLS, and associated fees to enable unrestricted access to data 
🚩Ensuring property listing visibility that entering the MLS system provides

Grant deliverables: 

✅ Initiate the building of the landing page
✅ Develop of database that will store data
✅ api fetch data from landing page to store on database

The research highlights how Ocean enables the monetization of private data while preserving privacy. @PalmerBTIG

Check out the full report: https://bit.ly/31s7mpT

Leveraging blockchain technology to put users in control of their data, the report branded Ocean as a strong ""alternative to data monopolies"". 

Main highlights: 

✅ The protocol, by creating tools for manipulating data infrastructures, unlocks “data legos.”

✅ Through OCEAN tokens, users are incentivized to make valuable data available, while maintaining its confidentiality. 

✅ Ocean Market–a decentralized exchange (DEX) tuned for data, allows for dynamic pricing of data sets with a Balancer-powered automated market maker (AMM).

✅ The growth and long-term sustainability of Ocean is ensured by @OceanDAO_ providing community-curated grants.

✅ Ocean Protocol’s V4 is coming soon and will include several improvements for rug pulls and tokenizing copyrights on data

Dive into all the specifics of Ocean by reading the full report and keep an eye on this space for our 2022 announcements coming soon!

Ocean Shipyard is a complementary funding layer to @OceanDAO_, which is a bottom-up, community-curated grants program. Ocean Shipyard has a top-down approach - the OPF selects the proposals and requires delivery according to specific milestones.
Grant payments are contingent on the successful delivery of project milestones within a stipulated time frame and will be made in OCEAN tokens.
Launched in 2020, the 1st edition of Shipyard received  60+ applications from projects keen to build on Ocean Protocol. Previous Shipyard grant recipients include @DataunionA, @swashapp, @TransportGenie & many more, each team exploring different approaches to data monetization.

More details on the grants program are available here:

Data Farming. Ocean ecosystem. What are H2O plans to remove OCEAN token’s volatility from transactions?

The latest blogpost by @H2O_data dives into how data as an asset class is going to be effectively monetized with Data Farming! ⚒️

Let's unlock 🔐

✅ Yield farming has been a driving narrative in DeFi and is a method that allows crypto users to earn more cryptocurrency and provides protocols with added liquidity to fuel protocol growth.

✅ Unlike yield farming, Ocean's Data Farming has actual utility for all stakeholders. The liquidity providers earn additional tokens, the protocol receives sustainable liquidity, and the users can trust the protocol's secured data assets.

✅ The Ocean Data Farmers are responsible for sourcing liquidity to the OCEAN datatoken pools; and, in turn,  receive rewards in the form of OCEAN tokens. The data farmers can further multiply these rewards by using their stake datasets.

✅ Transacting with Ocean Protocol's datasets requires using the OCEAN token and the H2O stable asset acts as a medium of exchange and unit of account and can be used for transacting with datatokens in the Ocean protocol - without token volatility.",,

OceanONDA V4 solves rug pulls in the datatoken pools, introduces data NFTs, expands the options for the community to monetize, and delivers updates to Ocean Market. 

💡Read more about the new features and the 18 month-journey to get here:
https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceanonda-v4-production-has-arrived-cb4fe8faaf39

All the key components of OceanONDA V4 are deployed to production chains on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Energy Web, and Moonriver.

1/ It is safer to stake liquidity in datatoken pools by solving rug pulls, through one-sided staking.✅

2/ A centrepiece of the OceanONDA V4 release is the introduction of ERC721 data NFTs. A data NFT represents the copyright (or exclusive license against copyright) for a data asset on the blockchain — the “base IP” (intellectual property).✅

3/ OceanONDA V4 has improved community monetization for selling data, running a marketplace or providing liquidity and it added a fourth one - by running your own Provider. This means more revenue upside and more flexibility in how fees can be charged.✅

💡Ocean Market V4 is live in production with updates like a new publish flow and a data NFT image generator:

https://market.oceanprotocol.com

💡Ocean docs are live in production, explore them here:

Data Providers: Publishing a dataset takes no more than 3 minutes. 

Just follow these simple steps 👇

1. Head over to the publish form here: https://market.oceanprotocol.com/publish/1 and enter the metadata 📝 of your Ocean Data NFT  

Note: You can publish your Data NFT on different chains. Namely #Ethereum #polygon #BSC #EWC #MoonRiver 💥

2. Select the #data access type ⚒

""Download"" is for non-sensitive information. It allows data buyers to download your dataset

""Compute-to-Data"" is for sharing sensitive data. Data is not downloadable, and the buyer can run compute jobs on it without accessing confidential data

3. Set the price 💰 

""Fixed"" prices the datatoken at the entered amount of OCEAN

""Dynamic"" creates an automated market for your dataset. This means the price is determined by the ratio of OCEAN to datatoken

""Free"" gives the datatoken for free via creating a faucet

4. Review & Publish ✅

At the end of last week, we noticed suspicious behaviour in several Ocean Market data pools that resulted in a loss of some OCEAN.

Here is an overview of what happened since, why it happened and the mitigation measures that are being taken to prevent further attack vectors.

Let's unpack👇 

https://t.co/qqIv32svbe

🚨 The first series of attacks took place last Thu around 7pm CEST time. Attacker executed the following actions in loop:

Stake OCEAN in a data pool
Buy datatokens
Unstake OCEAN
Sell datatokens

Through this sequence, small amounts of OCEAN were drained from data pools.

After reports from the Ocean community, we implemented the following change as short-term mitigation:

✅Raised the swap fee to 15% to make the attacks unprofitable

✅We also explored solutions in how to mitigate the risks long term

🚨 On Monday, July 11, the attacker re-started their attempts to drain Ocean data pools, this time using over $600,000 OCEAN.

Following feedback from the community and recent learnings, we are introducing veOCEAN to best align the incentives of token holders and liquidity providers.  

Continue reading 👇 <https://t.co/Cme16cby0x>

How?🌟 

veOCEAN holders can lock their $OCEAN tokens over a time period to earn rewards and voting power. The longer the lock period, the higher the rewards and the voting power.

They can also vote on proposals and earn rewards, both from consume fees and data farming.

veOCEAN holders can earn passive rewards, solely by locking their $OCEAN. 

Or, they can be active by allocating veOCEAN to higher-quality datasets for greater earnings.

Going forward, veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking $OCEAN and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools, and it delivers similar benefits.

Athena will add value to the ecosystem by developing an interface to accredit data prior to publishing and introducing easy-to-consume climate datasets🌊

Let's unpack!👇

✅Athena's mission is to build IoT and computing solutions for bridging the gap between the offline world and the blockchain world to ensure transparency, equity and algorithmic accountability in automated data collection and verification processes.

https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-shipyard-announces-its-first-2022-grantee-athena-protocol-50fdfdccbf2d

✅To facilitate ethical collection of data on a global scale, Athena leverages SolarPunk Network (SPN)

✅This enables real-time monitoring without sacrificing privacy whilst bridging the gap between stakeholders and the decision-making processes

How will it impact the Ocean ecosystem?🤔

🌊By Sept 2022, Athena will develop an interface for proposing data assets and managing asset portfolios. This will allow the team to focus on processes and procedures for Social Credentials & data NFTs.

🌊The first ESG asset verification suite v1 will be accredited and published soon after, allowing for multi-token contracts for algorithmic consensus.

🌊2 pilots with full-scale ESG MRV project proponents to quantify ecosystem services will also be launched.

$85,000 USD in OCEAN are available for Web3 data economy projects that will build on Ocean and contribute to its growing ecosystem!🌊

DDL - Aug 2 @ midnight UTC

Round 20 will be geared towards 👇
 
✅Biasing to those who engage for the love of doing it. An engaged, diverse community.

✅Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results. 

✅More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking overhead

Approaches to improving OceanDAO⚒️

🌊Starting with R21, the main pillar will be retroactive grants only for outcomes already achieved.

🌊OceanDAO will give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced ones, by capping the total funding amount for a project.

Round 20 Changes 👀

💡Total funding of 75,000 USD (min.)

💡100,000 USD max. per project in a lifetime

💡100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)

Funding ceiling per tier

💡New projects - 3K USD 

💡Existing projects -  7.5K USD (have completed one grant from OceanDAO)

💡Experienced projects - 15K USD (have completed two or more grants)

In the next Round 21, we will also introduce the following 👇

🚀Retroactive Grants - Projects will apply for grants that fund the outcome of work they did, not plan to do

🚀2 Months Cycle per Round - Total funding of 150,000 USD available

🚀New funding ceilings per tier

You are encouraged to submit proposals early via the Proposal Portal. Note that proposals can no longer be submitted through Ocean Port directly.

Acentrik’s collaboration with Ocean Protocol began in 2020, with a proof of concept exploring decentralized data orchestration for Mercedes-Benz. The pilot project was successful and this led to further collaboration and development of Acentrik Version 1.0. As part of the collaboration with Ocean Protocol, Acentrik Version 1.0 has leveraged and integrated specific Ocean features, with key adaptations made for enterprise users.

Acentrik is a fork of Ocean Market and makes use of the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries. Built on the foundation of Ocean technology, Acentrik’s mission is to make it easier for enterprises to unlock the value of decentralized data and enable data sharing with the principle of data sovereignty at the core. With Acentrik’s V1.0, enterprises can now publish datasets with parameters.

We're thrilled to announce that the integration with @H2O_data is completed, and $H2O is now available in Ocean Market. 

$H2O will enable data buyers and sellers to benefit from more price stability.

How? Let's take a quick look 👀

What is H2O and why is it important? 💧 

✅$H2O is an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by @reflexerfinance.

✅$H2O is decentralized, permissionless, minimizes governance and typically settles at ~$1.60

Since data can now be priced in $H2O, and $H2O fluctuates far less than $OCEAN, users can benefit from very little exposure to volatility in Ocean Market. This will bring two near-term benefits:

1️⃣  First, data sellers get more predictable revenue as revenue is no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.
2️⃣ Second, data buyers have more predictable costs as costs are no longer dependent on $OCEAN price.

❔How do I get $H2O tokens?
Locking OCEAN to mint $H2O via the H2O dapp here: https://app.h2odata.xyz  
Buy $H2O in an exchange such as the Uniswap: https://buff.ly/3ysO2p5>

Know What is❓H2O and why is it important by @oceanprotocol 

💠$H2O is an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by @reflexerfinance

💠$H2O is decentralized, permissionless, minimizes governance & typically settles at ~$1.60

💠Data can now be priced in $H2O & $H2O fluctuates far less than $OCEAN, users can benefit from very little exposure to volatility in Ocean Market✅

The project focuses on a versatile open source data aggregation system for the Ocean Protocol Community🌊
Let's take a deeper look 👀

✅Driven by the mission to create a database with verified properties for the proptech industry, Directimo aims to deliver the foundation to scrape most of the websites around the globe by developing a tool to extract data from various sites for further processing.

What are the benefits? 🤔

🛠The solution will minimize the programming knowledge that developers need to have to extract data from multiple sites in parallel. The data so collected will provide access to powerful insights from the market.

🌊Directimo will employ advanced technologies including Python, Redis and Kafka to create a distributed on-demand scraping cluster. The goal is to leverage this to further facilitate a real-estate model that’s scalable on a global level 👀

💬 @sjohns, Ecosystem & Partnerships, Ocean Protocol said:
""We are particularly excited because Directimo tools will be available to the entire Ocean community and will dramatically help onboard quality data onto Ocean.""

💬#AlexandruDan, CTO of Directimo, further commented:
""Web scrapers automatically collect information and data that's usually only accessible by visiting a website. By doing this autonomously, web scraping scripts open up a world of possibilities in data mining and analysis""

Get ready, Oceaners! 🛠️

👀veOCEAN goes live next Monday (Sep 26). Data Farming will resume three days later (Thursday)!🌊

Let's dive into the details!👇

⁉️What is veOCEAN? 
 It is the main mechanism for locking $OCEAN and for curating datasets on Ocean - it’s lower risk than datatoken pools, and delivers more benefits.

What can I do with veOCEAN?👇
✅ Lock $OCEAN to receive veOCEAN, and earn passive rewards. 

✅ Use veOCEAN to curate data with high Data Consume Volume (DCV) and get even more rewards.

✅ Vote on @OceanDAO_ proposals

Here is an overview of the timeline⏰

📅Sep 26: veOCEAN goes live. Lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN at http://df.oceandao.org

📅Sep 29: Counting for Data Farming /DF5 resumes

📅Oct 6: DF5 payouts resume. Counting starts for DF6

📅Oct 13: DF6 payout; DF7 counting starts

Please note ⚠️

DF will follow phases as before. When it resumes, it will be with a new “VE/DF Alpha” phase for 4 weeks. “DF Beta” and “DF Main” phases will follow, as previously targeted.

✅OceanDAO will be shifting more community budget to veOCEAN & Data Farming (more automated, yet aligned objectives), and away from grants (higher governance touch)

✅Retroactive grants will not be implemented at this point

This is what the funding will look like for this round: 

🌊55,000 USD allocated for the regular grants program

🌊10,000 USD will be allocated for Algovera AI micro-grants

💰New projects - 3K USD (New project: never previously received a grant from OceanDAO)

💰Existing projects - 6K USD (Existing project: have completed one grant from OceanDAO)

💰Experienced projects - 12K USD (Experienced project: have completed two or more grants)

Important note ⚠️

To submit proposals, participants must use the Proposal Portal here: https://seed.oceandao.org

Proposals will then be published on Ocean Port. All proposals that meet the essential criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.

✅Connect your Wallet
✅For each network where you staked: select network, click “Claim”, sign the TX, get rewards

Together we will leverage Ocean technology to power robust technical frameworks for robots and devices to share data 😍🔗

Deets👇

🏁Ocean and peaq already work together within the @moveID_gaiax consortium to build the Web3 infrastructure for the future of mobility.

👀The vision now is to expand the collaboration beyond the moveID framework for a wider and more direct integration.

💥As part of the collaboration:

✅Ocean will link its data marketplace with peaq’s economy of machine-generated goods and services to deliver a  data monetization toolkit for builders creating decentralized applications on the peaq network.

✅ Ocean's Compute-to-Data and data-pricing mechanisms will also be leveraged to power system architecture for a seamless exchange of information between providers and customers of mobility applications.

✅Future integrations will be designed to ensure that all machines running on peaq are able to seamlessly link with Ocean’s data marketplace and trade a vast array of data types in a secure peer-to-peer manner.

Hi everyone,

The new version of the Data Farming portal is out.
1. You will now be able to find the Passive, Active, and Global APY being reported in the Rewards page.
2. You will now be able to see the Average APY for Passive, Active, and Globally, when you are disconnected from the app.
3. You will now be able to see Your APY for Passive, Active, and Globally, when you are connected to the app and the needed requirements.
4. You should now be able to compare Your APY to the Global APY across each Reward Category, and get a better idea of how you are performing.

You can find the update here.
https://df.oceandao.org/

*Note #1: Active Rewards reports a variable APY that is constantly changing and starts at 0.0% at the beginning of every DF Round.
Note #2: Your APY and the Average APY can hit 0.00% when the Data Farming round resets, or if you're recently allocated. Farming is active and takes time to yield rewards.*

Happy Farming! 🧑‍🌾 👩‍🌾🚜",,🧑‍🌾 (3)

AI tools like ChatGPT are ALREADY trained on data that you produced and posted online for free.

What if you could force AI to *pay you for your data*? 🧐

Enter, Ocean Protocol.

When you use Ocean Protocol to tokenize your data on the blockchain, it becomes part of that immutable ledger of transactions that records ownership of the data token and you can use Ocean's smart contracts to transfer that token (for money or for free).

Flip the script on AI.

Upload data that you know AI tools will find valuable to the Ocean Market. 

Make AI pay you back.

🌊 Oceaners, we’re writing this message as a result of the unfortunate incident that happened on our Discord server recently. This morning we noticed that someone managed to gain control of the server by exploiting a vulnerability in the captcha system. As a result, they created a fake airdrop, and although our team was fast in catching this, it's possible that some of you may have accessed the link and experienced losses.

First, we want to say that we are sorry for any inconvenience and potential loss that this incident may have caused you. We understand it might have raised some concern and frustration within our community. And we take this very seriously, actively discussing internally, to find how we can best support those affected.

We want to assure you that our core team members are always taking numerous security measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA) and strong passwords for the accounts. Unfortunately, determined hackers can still find ways to exploit vulnerabilities, even with such precautions in place.

We want to emphasize that no OCEAN tokens were drained during this incident, and there were no casualties apart from the potential loss resulting from accessing the fraudulent link. However, we understand the impact this event can have on individuals within our community, and we are committed to learning from this experience to improve the security and resilience of our platform moving forward.
Moving forward, if you have been affected by this incident, please fill in this form: https://forms.gle/FbcG8gRVugZyq59s7.

We genuinely care about our community and will do everything we can to provide the necessary support and guidance during this time.

In light of recent events, we kindly remind our valued community members to exercise caution and diligence when it comes to airdrops or clicking on links. Take extra precautions, verify the authenticity of sources, and ensure official authorization. Your safety is paramount. If you're uncertain about any activity or encounter, please reach out to us. Together, we'll continue fostering a secure and resilient ecosystem. Your trust and support mean the world to us, and we're putting in our effort to prevent any similar incidents from happening in the future.

Thank you all for your understanding and being part of our incredible community and remember to stay vigilant! 🙌",,"❤️ (42),🫂 (14),ocean (12),🌊 (6)"

**Subject**: New Twitter Bounty Rewards for all Ocean Protocol Ambassadors 🌊

GM Sailors, we are thrilled to introduce a revamped bounty program, with new rewards for your Twitter campaigns 🐦

Starting this Sunday 15th October, we will introduce a 2-tiered reward system for Twitter bounties with both: 🔹Base Rewards & 🔸Bonus Rewards

**🔹 Base Reward**
Every week, the **Top 3** threads with the highest number of impressions 📈 will receive a $100 Base Reward 💵 To be eligible for this reward, a minimum of 250 impressions on your thread is required 📊

**🔸 Bonus Reward**
In addition to the Base Reward, we are introducing a $100 Bonus Reward 🌟 which will be given every week to the best thread of the week 🏆 as voted by the Ocean Protocol community 👥

📋 How It Works

1️⃣Write up a twitter thread 🧵 about Ocean Protocol tagging @oceanprotocol or $OCEAN. Each week there's a different topic so make sure to check the ""Topic of the Week"" first
2️⃣Apply, and paste the link of your Twitter thread here: https://x.postmint.xyz/community/6526b1df4300e98ead0166d9/6527aa954300e98ead016e44
3️⃣Base Rewards will be automatically paid out at the end of each week (yayyyy, faster payments🎉) and Bonus Rewards will be manually distributed each week after the community voting 🗳️ 

By incorporating both Base and Bonus Rewards, we aim to increase reach & awareness around the New Data Economy 🌐

If you get stuck, feel free to watch this video: https://www.loom.com/share/c2aea12aa00d408e8d8a33930f61eccb?sid=37555eed-2a07-4f23-8e80-75a4460ebfb7 or reach out for support

Ocean Protocol can leverage its technology for AI and datasets to the general consumer market by providing a user-friendly interface for data providers and consumers to interact with the marketplace.
