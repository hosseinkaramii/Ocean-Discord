2021-07-02 00:00:00.000,,carmina19,491398040729681900,Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],hello @ashie! ocean protocol doesn't rely on the ocean to buy & sell data. the ocean smart contracts and drivers allow for any token to be used  in any exchange setting  since datatokens are erc20 tokens. ocean market app has chosen to use ocean  to buy / sell / stake ocean datatokens. other apps can use other tokens. for example bdp market uses bdp tokens. ocean market itself will move to using an ocean-backed stablecoin when the tech is ready. this is all fine from an ocean perspective  because using ocean as a unit-of-exchange doesn't help drive fundamental value. even more importantly  ocean token has been designed to have strong core value drivers: (a) increase in ocean usage -> increase in network revenue -> increase in ocean burned; (b) governance token to allocate funding towards growth of ocean; and more. details are at https://oceanprotocol.com/token. hope that is a bit clearer. if you have any curiosities about ocean  feel free to ask. ☺️,,,

(and this stake is safe: you can’t lose your ocean as it is merely locked.),,,

(https://bscscan.com/token/0x3516141b1ac8751c2042a8a1bc411ab8655464ac)  multichain (former anyswap: https://multichain.org ) told me ocean team wrote it. which dev wrote it?  2) and why did i get shit tokens from multichain if the bridging from eth to bsc was ok with no liquidity problems since it was "successful" ?  i just want the real assets i should have get and not fake coins 🔥  last time i ask.  thanks,,,

2023-04-09 00:00:00.000,,dscrdnm,808441136045621200,Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],doesn't matter now as no one is using the marketplaces anyway but if they take off  or a successful dapp launches  it doesn't mean that the $ocean price will be bolstered by much. there is a mechanism for returning 1-3% of transaction fees (i forget the exact amount) to the ocean protocol foundation if a marketplace (or dapp?) does not use $ocean as its main currency. the opf can then choose to use a portion of that revenue to buy back $ocean from the open market (in theory) but increaseing $ocean price isn't a priority of the tokenomics. i actually don't know if they really need it to happen.  widespread use of ocean tech could suffice as success,,,

2023-04-09 00:00:00.000,,dscrdnm,808441136045621200,Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],disagree on that. there would have to be a tremendous amount of buy back for it to really affect the $ocean price in the first place. the entire 1-3% wouldn't be earmarked for bb. it would be a tiny portions of that and the rest assigned for other activities. secondly  buy back is just a mooted option. in reality the the fees are more likely to be used to build the wider ocean economy and for long-term sustainability of the project (sensible). finally afaik there is no mention of the fees being paid directly to $ocean holders in any of the team articles or interviews i've seen. if there is  would be intersting to see.,,,
