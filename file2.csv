(10k club  100kclub  3letters club  24h club)  the ens ecosystem will probably kick off the growth of different collections the same way we saw with opensea - in which each collection has their stewards + utlity sort to speak. this is not directly related to data  but a trend to hook on perhaps.  lots to discuss and not a clear direction yet  but i agree that pfps will have stronger utility and could help op/datanfts gain more exposure.",,,

2021-04-10 14:51:00,,.scottm3,401223631050506240,Ocean Protocol - ECOSYSTEM - 🪢︱ambassadors [769209726415929404],the objective of this question is to get a clear understanding of the unique value proposition of ocean so that we can better serve  and strategically implement ocean protocol’s vision in the market.   as we understand  the ocean protocol is ultimately a 2 sided marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of data. one could have a popular dataset on an ocean market which generates $500 000 in revenue and another person may have 500 datasets on ocean market generating $0 in revenue based on the demand for their data assets.   it’s possible (but unlikely) that i am going to receive a lot of money for sharing my personal location data. even in the best case scenario i may generate a few $100 dollars which some may find attractive but most will encounter too much friction/hesitation towards opening up and sharing their personal data for some relatively small sum of money. (this may not be the case in all situations/countries as a few hundred dollars will be a lot of money but in those cases the buying power of that consumer base would be lower and therefore the incentive for businesses to leverage that data would be lower also).,,,
2021-04-10 14:51:00,,.scottm3,401223631050506240,Ocean Protocol - ECOSYSTEM - 🪢︱ambassadors [769209726415929404],therefore  the higher value datasets for ocean are likely those held in big privately held databases or brokered in other partnering models like: www.datarade.ai which could:     1.    benefit from being used in machine learning algorithms  ai etc to create value (i.e. there is demand for the data).       2.    be sold to the market without the company receiving a significant backlash from existing customers/business partners/shareholders i.e. the benefits of enabling access to the data (revenues generated) outweigh the costs of providing secure access to the data for the market to consume. one could imagine a backlash against a local retailer if customers discovered that all of a sudden their shopping data was being sold by the retailer for profit.  this is where we start to get a little stuck… if there is huge revenue potential sitting behind closed doors (in privately held databases)  then why wouldn’t a more traditional private company have come along and given the owners of these datasets the ability to compute against the datasets privately? is this the secret sauce that’s only enabled through ocean protocol?  if not  then is it the open  networked and decentralised nature of the ocean protocol? under this assumption we are assuming that an open  networked and decentralised org structure is the superior org structure for executing on this opportunity.   it would be great to better understand this topic so that we can more accurately convey the usp to the market. knowing the answer to this should also help indicate where to start looking for new business opportunities with ocean.,,,
2021-04-10 19:26:00,,robinlehmann,194817764236460030,Ocean Protocol - ECOSYSTEM - 🪢︱ambassadors [769209726415929404],the secret sauce part with compute to data is one important factor but the other factor that makes ocean standout is the pricing mechanism of the assets. this expands ocean from being a two sided market to much more. the stakers become a part of the market as well. they curate  price and validate datasets but also benefit from that.  the combination of these features makes ocean a 🦄.  i am very open to have sessions with you and @mark to discuss this further and create an overview and analysis paper.,,,
2021-04-10 19:42:00,,Frederic#8800,318820697436717060,Ocean Protocol - ECOSYSTEM - 🪢︱ambassadors [769209726415929404],(damn  robin was already here while i was typing 😄 as always 🚀 👏🏼 )  hi scott! these are super valuable thoughts. thanks for sharing! the answer includes my personal perspective  there is potentially a lot more  but this is what is important in my opinion:  with compute-to-data you can sell data access without having the problems you mentioned. if set up correctly  there is no “backslash” from customers/business partners/shareholders because the data is never moved  data consumers never see the data itself.  still  you (and any buyer) can generate insights on private data in a fully compliant way. this includes machine learning  business analytics  or other forms of data aggregation. it’s not about the data owner who can compute here. it’s about any potential buyer. and because ocean is permissionless  this could be anyone.  as you say  this is a risk/reward trade-off. and the more sensitive the data  the more security you need to balance the risk.   data monetization makes sense for traditional companies in many cases  even when companies compete. mobi is an example where traditional automakers can potentially share datasets for autonomous driving (without giving away the data) to compete with tesla. in other cases  data can be a “byproduct” of a companies core business. in this case  it’s only a cost-center and they could start monetizing it. compared to what is on the market right now  c2d is more about huge and valuable datasets. there are many similar examples we could think of.  “turn your data storage into a profit center” (while keeping ownership and full control and being compliant) is one of the opportunities here.,,,
2021-04-12 1:56:00,,.scottm3,401223631050506240,Ocean Protocol - ECOSYSTEM - 🪢︱ambassadors [769209726415929404],hi @robin | dataunion   @frederic and @kaimeinke thank you for your thoughts.  the pricing mechanism is definitely an interesting feature and one where the incentives that exist would probably be harder to replicate in a private model (in my head i keep comparing this to a private venture  not to discredit the ocean project but to instead uncover the unique benefits of op). staking tokens on datasets encourages market participants to curate good data and send a signal to the market that ‘this is good data’ which is great.   open and permissionless access to data for c2d applications to run on is also another great benefit. assuming this means that some people (with good intentions!) are accessing datasets they couldn’t otherwise access through other third party providers already.   data unions and shared data initiatives (like scanning bills and monetising as a group) is also a unique and interesting concept. in theory i could probably start something like that today (as a private venture) but be subject to a number of local laws and regulations (friction) and so doing something like this on op where the incentives are closer to the consumer than they maybe are in a private model could be a unique benefit.,,,
2021-04-12 1:56:00,,.scottm3,401223631050506240,Ocean Protocol - ECOSYSTEM - 🪢︱ambassadors [769209726415929404],thinking these scenarios through is starting to lead me down the path of… maybe the networked  permissionless and incentive based model is a fundamentally superior model for mass scale than a private model. i.e. a private company can only hire so quickly  expand into new markets so quickly and jump on new trends so quickly. in other words it can only spread its incentives so thinly before it runs out.   op (and other decentralised projects for that matter) are more organic and take on a life of their own. as they are open and permissionless  anyone can jump on board  have a go  at no cost to the overarching entity (op) i.e  not many people are spending their spare time thinking up new ways for jeff bezos to grow his empire - he has to employ people to do that for him.   therefore  those that jump on board and build things the market wants are rewarded and those that don’t  simply try again or fade away. the equivalent would be trying to convince a bunch of investors to invest in a private company where we will pay anyone who walks in through the door to do stuff and some will succeed and others will fail but we don’t really know what’s going to happen. 😆   i feel like i’ve either gone on a complete tangent or am touching on something fundamentally important?,,,

'ivan' is a fitting name for a dev. it connotes the right mindset. someone who’s honourable and concerned about the quality of the code. the name is also not tied to any specific country. could even be american  like alice & bob are.  thus the main character in our user story is now ivan  and i think it’s a real improvement. thanks for your feedback  it proved valuable. 🙏",,,
