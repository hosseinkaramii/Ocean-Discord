[created issue https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379]   there seem to be two separate concerns. (1) unclear how to handle super-large dataset with many files (2) concern of high initial liquidity needs for valuable dataset. i responded thoroughly in the github issue created. https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/379#issuecomment-780686815. let's do further iterations there.  > (2) datasets published before the pump have now increased in value but also the price per token is now 3x higher than before. that will prevent sales. the problem will (hopefully) increase over time.  note that is something that people can arb for  based on what they think the value is denominated in. just like in any other amms in uniswap  balancer  etc.   however we can soften this to reduce the effects of impermanent loss  by ""ocean-backed stablecoin in market"". that's targeted for q2.  finally  ""better staking"" (q4) will decouple amount of stake from price.   > (3) whats currently missing in the market is the buy/consume side. to attract real consumers to the market i would consider vouchers for potential consumers to spend on datasets for a limited time. e.g. 2000 ocean to spend on data within 24h.  agreed in this goal.

(a) compute-to-data where the ""compute"" is selection of the subset of data. how to price: if you have s / m / l selection sizes  then have one amm for each selection size. you could use this approach in your dataunion app. or ocean market might support it when it fully supports compute-to-data  though this looks like an extra feature on top so it could be a while.  (b) have a different datatoken for each of the 1000+ files; then make a ""basket"" token to bundle them together  using eg set protocol  balancer (v2 for >8 tokens)  or erc998. one question is how to price. one way is to have an amm for each base item; arbitrage bots will keep prices fairly balanced. another way is to have fixed price on each base item. a second question is what's the best way to bundle; different things would need to be tried. a third q is how to have those bundles in ocean market or otherwise; ocean market will evolve that way starting with "">1 pool per datatoken""  but this could extend.",,,

""arbitrary"" is a synonym for ""unlimited complexity"" human capability to deal with complexity is very limited and human and artificial intelligence is fundamentally different.  what is going to happen if the number of labels is growing in an uncontrolled fashion is that there is no consistency between labels and image content. that will have a significant negative impact on ai and therefore on the value of the dataset. inconsistent and low quality datasets are still the norm today. in order to create and *maintain* a dataset of high value it is imo mandatory to have a fabric that links labels to image content from an ai and *not* a human perspective. to prevent introducing human perception bias into the data i highly recommend to have this in place before starting.",,,

2021-07-02 18:54:00,,carmina19,491398040729681900,Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],hello @ashie! ocean protocol doesn't rely on the ocean to buy & sell data. the ocean smart contracts and drivers allow for any token to be used  in any exchange setting  since datatokens are erc20 tokens. ocean market app has chosen to use ocean  to buy / sell / stake ocean datatokens. other apps can use other tokens. for example bdp market uses bdp tokens. ocean market itself will move to using an ocean-backed stablecoin when the tech is ready. this is all fine from an ocean perspective  because using ocean as a unit-of-exchange doesn't help drive fundamental value. even more importantly  ocean token has been designed to have strong core value drivers: (a) increase in ocean usage -> increase in network revenue -> increase in ocean burned; (b) governance token to allocate funding towards growth of ocean; and more. details are at https://oceanprotocol.com/token. hope that is a bit clearer. if you have any curiosities about ocean  feel free to ask. ☺️,,,
