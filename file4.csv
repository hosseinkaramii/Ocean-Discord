We're building out a credential data network and projects are using us to leverage credential data on-chain and off-chain through task-based NFTs to build stronger communities and products. You can consider us a growth marketing tool and an infrastructure to build out loyalty programs in the form of NFTs. 
We have worked with many DEX's to help them reward loyal and early contributors, drive awareness + engagement + knowledge of their product, and increase their user base while also driving social activity on social platforms. Some of our partners include Binance, Solana, Polygon, Hashflow, and Yearn Finance.

Thus, you could say that the token captures the value of the overall data quality on the Ocean Market as the token's value is driven by supply / demand for data consumption. Of course, there is speculation around this token as with every other crypto token, and often the valuation includes sentiment about how valuable $OCEAN will be in the future when data sharing of Ocean dataNFTs and datatokens occurs more and more on EVM blockchains.

First, 
what i see on the explorer is a contract for OCEAN tokens. Not ""anytokens"", so please show me on a screenshot how  do you know it is a fake coin, and how we are supposed to know if even MULTICHAIN support does not talk about it when I reach to them ?
So, now that I was not informed during the bridging that they gave me a fake coin in exchange of my real OCEAN assets, I sent them directly to binance BSC ocean wallet and they pretend those coins are now in space and lost. 
It is interesting to me how your partner can just steal my assets (by stealing the name of YOUR brand to cheat us) pretending they have your assets but they give me fake coin instead. By the way they gave me 100% in this other token. So there was NO LIQUIDITY AT ALL. And nothing was notified.
Can you tell me how can this be just ok for everybody ? How would you think about all this if you went through it  What would you do now ?  what are the solutions now  please ? This is what interest me here seen the situation. 
How can I recover those assets, even if they are fake OCEAN coins, to get my money back ? 
Will there be a clever dev who can help since you are partnering also with Binance
Thanks a lot in advance, hope this can be recoverd",,

The token you received is not a fake token, it is a token created by Anyswap. You can see that the token is tagged as ""Anyswap: OCEAN Protocol"" in the BSC explorer. To further understand how it works and why you received this token, please refer to sections 2.2 and 2.3 in the Multichain docs.

If you've already sent the tokens to an exchange, I suggest you contact the exchange's support team and explain the situation. They might be able to help you and return the tokens. In that case, you should be able to exchange them back to OCEAN through Multichain (Anyswap). For more information about this, please see the ""2.3 Liquidity Removal"" section in the Multichain docs.

I will also bring this issue up to the team to see if there is another solution. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any other questions or if you need any further assistance.

Sending me back to the dos does not help. it just says we can get anytoken if not enough liquidity. It is even not well detailed, explained, and as I said, I got no notification of this. Impossible to know I got a fake temporary coin counterfeiting your brand instead of my real OCEAN asset.
 
As a customer they do not care. Binance just said I have to pay 500$ for them to investigate what is ""lost"". This is the kind of respect we get.
I suppose if you partner with them, a dev could know what to do and help me seen the situation ? Would be a great move as you offer to do. 
I definitely wait for you to come back with some hope.
Because Multichain is a scam for now. I don't even understand how they can start a swap knowing they don't have liquidity AT ALL and make me the scammed one.

Keep me posted then, thanks a lot",,

Or do I have to read all those 20+ blog posts about data farming to figure this out? Cause they all just talk about hypothetical scenarios. What are the real life numbers now that multiple farming rounds have been done? The post you linked talks about some liquidity pools which are not there. And no distinction between active and passive rewards. And that post claims we should have something between 66% - 125% APY in the 5.3 Example APYs table. Is this active or passive rewards?

Where is your documentation on expected APY on passive rewards? Your app currently says ""6.35% Avg APY"" for passive rewards and ""0.00% Avg APY"" for active reqwards. So nothing like 66% -125% but then again there are numbers being thrown around here without any real-life validation. Would be great to actually have a single place documented about this.

Earlier, when you mentioned that you expected a high APY ~100%. You may have been confusing APY with the lock multiplier when you locked your OCEAN for veOCEAN. When you locked for 4 years, your lock multiplier was 100% - thus, you received 100% veOCEAN for all of your OCEAN locked. APY is separate from the lock multiplier.

I’m Paul a representative for Stuart (AKA The Wordsmith) - a bestselling author and tier 1 content writer in the space. He has worked with numerous well-known projects and produced countless articles and press releases (among numerous other types of content) – many which have gone viral.

As a scout I reach out to awesome projects I know Stuart would love to work with. To that end, I was hoping to speak to a member of the team so I can put them in touch with the Wordsmith directly to see if they might want to have him produce content for the company. I can also link them to his website, which has a bunch of examples as well as testimonials from other project leads. 

So could someone direct me to who would be best to speak to? Thank you and hope you all have an awesome rest of your day 😊",,

Great question! When a user pays for access to your dataset using datatokens, they are essentially purchasing a license to use the data for a specific purpose. The license terms can be set by you, the data owner, and enforced by smart contracts. This means that if a user tries to share or sell the data without permission, they would be in violation of the license terms and could face penalties or loss of access to the data. 
Additionally, you can publish data as c2d. This means that users don't get access to your dataset but they can run algorithms(that you approve of) on top of that data and download only the results of the computation.",,

I understand your frustration, however I would like to point out that we have also tried to communicate with you directly. Our colleague, @White Rider reached out to you on discord, yet you didn’t reply, and Bruce also explained the situation on Linkedin. Let me give you some more information on what happened. 
There are two ways to move tokens between eth and bsc: binance bridge and multichain bridge. They both work fine, but they create different versions of ocean token on bsc. The one you used was multichain bridge, which gave you ocean tokens with this address: 0x3516141b1ac8751c2042a8a1bc411ab8655464ac. The problem is that when you wanted to go back to eth, you used binance bridge instead of multichain bridge. Binance bridge only recognizes ocean tokens with this address: 0xdce07662ca8ebc241316a15b611c89711414dd1a. So when you sent your tokens to binance bridge, they got lost because binance doesn't track them.",,

But I NEVER USED Binance bridge. NEVER. I used MULTICHAIN Bridge from eth chain to BSC chain. And I received the fake token you mention. INDEED. I never ""went back to eth"" I do NOT understand what bs you talk ABOUT?? . Show me on the blockchain a link and proof of this nonsense. I have all the screendhots and the explorer shows it clearly. Why this bs about binance bridging or ""coming back to eth"" ? 
Besides that I always replied to @White Rider which did not answered my questions either. Like Bruce Pon on LinkedIn which totally missed the point too trying to avoid my questions LIKE HERE. 
Out of 9 questions I will ask 2 only AGAIN in hope I'll have a proper answer this time about this theft rather than avoiding them all the time. Be honest and pro at least. 
 
1) Who wrote the smart contract that gave me shitcoins instead of my real assets?
(https://bscscan.com/token/0x3516141b1ac8751c2042a8a1bc411ab8655464ac) 
Multichain (former Anyswap: https://multichain.org ) told me Ocean team wrote it. Which dev wrote it?

2) And why did I get shit tokens from MULTICHAIN if the bridging from eth to BSC was ok with no liquidity problems since it was ""successful"" ?

I just want the real assets I should have get and not fake coins 🔥 
Last time I ask. 
Thanks",,

May it be @White Rider or @trizin  @Mihai | Ocean sadly.  I simply checked your links and the blochchain myself and I saw that you bridged on Multichain indeed from eth to bsc. And that you received a fake coin. You should have received the correct one on this contract after bridging  (0xdce07662ca8ebc241316a15b611c89711414dd1a). This is scary and concerning. I'll check with my lawyer also to give you some infos about those acts of stealing assets and creating unregistered securities. I had this problem before and we got i touch with SEC.

Q1: Who wrote the smart contract that gave me shitcoins instead of my real assets?
(https://bscscan.com/token/0x3516141b1ac8751c2042a8a1bc411ab8655464ac)
Multichain (former Anyswap: https://multichain.org/ ) told me Ocean team wrote it. Which dev wrote it?
A: The contracts were written by multichain and are owned by them. We have no control over the bridges that are created, as anyone can create bridges.
The tokens that multichain release are valid coins that you can bridge back to Ethereum, through the multichain bridge.
Q2: And why did I get shit tokens from MULTICHAIN if the bridging from eth to BSC was ok with no liquidity problems since it was “successful” ?
A: Based on your previous messages and transaction, it looks like you did send the tokens to the binance bridge. Binance has automated services and probably can’t access that wallet , you should probably contact them for more information. See the attached screenshots for more support details. Binance is displaying what contract address is expecting and multichain is warning you.
I do hope that this helps shed some light into your matter and will support in you finding some resolution.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1092455348452995072/Screenshot_2023-04-03_125026.png?ex=65e5da53&is=65d36553&hm=a8c77789f1043ab803741e06ee3f9dde2beb140c9b8483be066f8e24ae70f9a6&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1092455348704657448/binance.png?ex=65e5da53&is=65d36553&hm=96c1ca48870c42492087ab1e72c26cdeb731fc5cd4041c6b197b042319925e16&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1092455348968886322/multichain.png?ex=65e5da54&is=65d36554&hm=908bb3d90b8a84d0c3d21bae4995de830384326ef9dda468aca2d92839809f3f&",

Could someone from Ocean Protocol or DeltaDAO please help to understand the impact of EUROe to the utility of OCEAN?

For question 1, Multichain said Ocean team wrote the contract. Seems they lie then? I can provide screenshot also. 😉 

For question 2, I'm not asking about anything after the bridging (bridging was, made on metamask, from mm to mm) . I'm asking why did the bridging say status ""successful"" . Why was he ""successful"" if there was no liquidity enough (and giving temporary shit token), confusing us in thinking we had the right token?
Did you see this STATUS? . or do you need a screenshot?
Cheers",,

Regarding question 1 . I'm no disputing what you discussed with them. We didn't write or deploy any contract for the bridge. Anybody can create a bridge for any token. As you can see on https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bridge there are 2 alternative bridges (they probably have a partnership/agreement with them, we are not involved in this) . As well as for other chains there are multiple bridges. Unfortunately the user needs to figure out what bridge he wants or needs to use. You can also provide the screenshot .
Regarding question 2, you got the tokens, so the status was indeed ""successful"" . They didn't give you a shit token, but that token can only be bridged back to eth only on the multichain bridge. I agree with you, bridging in web3 is a bit confusing . You need to pay attention to all the addresses and instructions. This would have had the same outcome with any token that you bridged , not just ocean.",,

There is a mechanism for returning 1-3% of transaction fees (I forget the exact amount) to the Ocean Protocol Foundation if a marketplace (or dApp?) does not use $ocean as its main currency. The OPF can then choose to use a portion of that revenue to buy back $ocean from the open market (in theory) but increaseing $ocean price isn't a priority of the tokenomics. I actually don't know if they really need it to happen.  Widespread use of Ocean Tech could suffice as success",,

There would have to be a tremendous amount of buy back for it to really affect the $ocean price in the first place. The entire 1-3% wouldn't be earmarked for BB. It would be a tiny portions of that and the rest assigned for other activities. Secondly, buy back is just a mooted option. In reality the the fees are more likely to be used to build the wider Ocean economy and for long-term sustainability of the project (sensible). Finally AFAIK there is no mention of the fees being paid directly to $ocean holders in any of the team articles or interviews i've seen. If there is, would be intersting to see.",,

Ocean is 'better' than others with a bigger cap so it should have a big cap too? Not sure what metric is being used to determine this. Those larger cap projects generally have more trading volume whether by design (tokenomics) or a larger community. Adoption is the only way ocean will see rapid increase in value. If organic volume comes to the ecosystem then it could outperform otherwise it will largely follow the market (bot trading).,,

Native turns “exchange” into a feature so any app can deploy their own swap in minutes.

Using Native, projects earn all their own swap fees. Depending on volume, fee revenue can be upwards of 6-7 figures / month, straight to the project treasury.

Native also has integrations with professional market-makers (PMMs) which are normally only available to CEXs. This makes it super easy (and free) for a project to go live with a tier 1 liquidity provider on chain. Using Native is a way to get deep liquidity and high capital efficiency on-chain without losing revenue through emissions or incentives.

At the end of the day, Native is about helping projects get more liquidity and earn more revenue. Let me know if you would like to further discuss how we can help you increase revenue while creating a seamless experience for your users.

Thank you✌🏻",,

From the article: ""This (minting the rest of the supply) will make it un-pausable, and fully decentralized & censorship-resistant."" 
How? These are just buzzwords with no explanation... how is that 7 anonymous people controlling 56%+ of the supply is unpausable, censorship resistant, or decentralised? (Not to mention the other ~30% under Binance's control)

This whole process seems so suspicious to me and the inadequate explanation even more so. Completely dejected from this project and disappointed how communication with the community has been neglected.",,

Tokens are issued to be minted, otherwise why would a project deploy their token all together? 

Now, a project may decide to mint all of them on day 1, or leave a portion to be minted at a later schedule. That’s why often times you see a lower “circulating supply market cap” than “fully diluted market cap”.
Chainlink is a good example: https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca

The Ocean whitepaper should be the one and only reference, and as I said, the AMA has added no more information than the one was already presented to the community via the 2 articles above.

Within the whitepaper you can see that 719,100,000 OCEAN (51%) has always been earmarked for community incentives as per Ocean tokenconomics.

Now, of this amount:

- 503,370,000 OCEAN (70% of the 51%) is for Data Farming with vesting over decades.

You can also look at the vesting schedule directly from the Github/source code, as all code/actions are ALWAYS open-sourced and well documented in our github. 
Vesting schedule halving example: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol 

- 215,730,000 OCEAN (30% of the 51%) is for future community incentives projects, held by the 51% multisig wallet. 

I hope this clarifies!",,

The AMA was about revoking control over the minting contract by minting all the tokens. Why are you explaining basic tokenomics to me? 

Let me make myself very clear and please correct me if I'm wrong. 
All of the tokens have been minted onto the Ethereum blockchain, in lieu of the team having control over the minting contract. 
The newly minted tokens are stored in a number (?) of multi-sig wallets controlled by 7 entities. 
(Can we have the addresses of these wallets?)
A new 'un-pausable' contract has been created to vest the tokens as community rewards through DF.
**Why have the team done this? What problem did this remedy?** **How is this 'fully decentralised'? How is this 'censorship resistant'? **

Now we have to __trust__ these 7 entities, (who will remain anonymous I assume) to carry out the same tokenomics for decades. 
The tokenomics have been altered at least 2 times in the last 2 years.

What's the github link you sent? Is this the current contract working on the new multi-sig wallets or the old contract?",,

Not precisely, the 719,100,000 OCEAN (51% of OCEAN supply) has been sent to 1 single wallet, not multiple wallets. You can check the TX: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9286ab49306fd3fca4e79a1e3bdd88893042fcbd23ddb5e705e1029c6f53a068 for more details. The wallet holding the newly minted Ocean is: 0x4D9B76Df13DF257A674AEc7Ec7232741A6E73883

This wallet is ""controlled"" by 7 signees, correct. The signees are from OPF, OPC and other renowned signees that are well renowned in the Web3 space.

1) Why is the token un-pausable and more decentralised now? 
Because the majority of newly minted tokens are programmed to go towards Data Farming following a BTC-like vesting curve. The contracts proving the release & vesting are open-source and can always be monitored at: 

- https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol
- https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletLinear.sol

  2) Why has the team renounced ownership?
To have one less point of failure in the system. Ocean's vision has always been to slowly (**but responsibly**) move to a fully decentralised architecture, with ideally zero points of failure to make Ocean fully censorship resistant. 

However, this comes in little steps. And as the technology becomes more mature/robust, the more smart contract automation will be taking place. And more keys will be thrown away (hence also the multi-sig). 

This is what further enhance security and will eventually make Ocean fully community-owned, just like Bitcoin. No owners, but its community!

A dataNFT (ERC721) has its own DID and DDO. Within the DDO you can define one, or more than one, services. Each service has it’s own DT.

Example, let’s imagine you want to sell a JavaScript course. These are 2 examples of how you could Ocean DTs:

EXAMPLE 1
The course is called JavaScript, and has 3 tiers. This course will be represented as a dataNFT with its own DID/DDO. In the DDO, you add 3 services to represent each tier, each of which will be represented by its own datatoken.

JavaScript Course (ERC721)
JavaScript Basics for Beginners (DT1 for free)
JavaScript Intermediate (DT2 @ USDC 100)
JavaScript Full Course (DT3 @ USDC 299)
(edited)

EXAMPLE 2
Alternatively, each tier can also be represented as a dataNFT and have its own DID/DDO with only one service:

JavaScript Basics for Beginners (ERC721)
DT1 for free
JavaScript Intermediate (ERC721)
DT1 @ USDC 100
JavaScript Full Course (ERC721)
DT1 @ USDC 299

Each service can be customised quite flexibly to have a different price, expiry date, whitelist and more",,👍 (3)

Hi everyone, I've recently been able to ramp up the efforts behind OceanNouns and we've been putting out some updates.
We're now looking forward to your feedback.

The NFT collection is built on top of the NounsDAO stack and will end up having nearly the exact same architecture/mechanisms.
You can read a bit more about the project here:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DZHKLbfOjz_5jR7qdZfC_ol-j0nPi95V1zbkCbaOiOM/edit#slide=id.p

**[Nouns & Art Feedback]**
Our artist wanted to try a few different things and ended up creating a bunch of characters that we both love.
However, we're really looking forward to building with the community and wanted to get people's feedback.
https://twitter.com/oceannouns/status/1664044458147737600

**[Sample NFTs & Traits]**
I attached a couple more characters to give you all a feel for the style.

**[Sample Teaser]**
We also put together a little teaser.
https://twitter.com/oceannouns/status/1668854170282254336

**[Questions for the community]**
How do you feel about this art direction when compared to NounsDAO?
(if the images are too big, try zooming out, Nouns are 32x32 pixels big)

Are there any projects that are doing liquid staking wrappers for veOCEAN?

3-VeOcean operations occur only on the Ethereum Mainnet, but you can allocate veOcean to datasets on multiple  chains.",,🙏 (1)

I don't understand what you mean about the DF program, according to the schedule: the DF program rewards just keep growing over time until they reach 1.1M OCEAN/wk. Why would the wash trading become less profitable now, and why would the rewards since round 29 be 0.00% APY for the active side (the allocation increased from 37500 per week to 75000, but they APY went to 0.00%)?",,

This was discontinued as of DF 29.  This caused a dramatic decline in active APY.
What we want is real consume volume in the market, that's why the team fixed the wash trading problem.
Active APY will start to increase again once the real consume volume kicks off.

The structure looks like this - 

1) you locked your 100 ocean for 6 months , and in return you will get Veocean . Now, by either just holding your VeOcean , you can earn passive rewards or you can stake them on potential datasets and earn active rewards ! 

That's the basic understanding of it . 

But, during the end period of your lock period , your VeOcean starts to decay and if you want to earn more, you need to relock your ocean token

I have a question about Compute 2 Data & selling Data using Ocean Marketplace

**Option 1:** So if you sell the **dataset**, as downloadable, the user has it and now can do wtv they want with it, including copying and sharing it. 

**Option 2: ** Make the dataset, **Compute**. Now here there is the 3 step process "" create an algorithm that's compatible with C2D, publish your C2D-specific algorithm NFT, then publish your data NFT with C2D configurations allowing the algorithm to compute on it. "" I understand this keeps the data private while providing access to use it.

Either scenario would require adjusted settings when you publish the dataset to the market,,
Ocean Protocol - GENERAL - 💭︱general-chat [612953349003673629],843831770062913568,white_rider_,07/19/2023 4:47 PM,"Hello @Databites.eth 
Let me try to respond to your questions:

Option 1 - If you choose to publish a dataset as downloadable, interested buyers can acquire datatokens to gain access to it. The data provider ensures privacy by encrypting the source details such as the URL or IPFS id. However, buyers can download the data. When users purchase access through datatokens, they essentially obtain a license to use the data for a specific purpose set by the data provider and enforced by smart contracts. Nevertheless, tracking and monitoring if they share or use the data differently from its intended purpose can be challenging due to the decentralized nature of the system.

Option 2 - Anyone can develop algorithms to process your dataset. To facilitate this, it's crucial to include sufficient information in the dataset documentation, allowing users to understand its structure without directly accessing the raw data. Best practices involve providing a sample file that demonstrates the data's format.
However, to prevent potential data theft or misuse, the data publisher must approve algorithms before they are allowed to run on the dataset. This approval process helps ensure that only trustworthy and non-malicious algorithms can access and process the data, safeguarding its integrity and security.


I hope this clears up any confusion you may have.",,

Might be something like, downloable dataset but with 6 month timelag and an educational walkthrough for using the dataset with AI to gain insights.

 The C2D is a bit more of a professional service, would have up to date data but not be downloable only computable.

Not sure yet, first need to better understand ocean

Some alternatives include using the data we collect to build our own AI model thus allowing peoplw to analyze it in natural language, but im not sure yet where the ocean stack fits in to this part",,

Can you accurately predict the price of ETH? 

There's 5,000 OCEAN in weekly prizes for those who can do it with the lowest error.

https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97

We've run ""Predict-ETH"" Data Challenges for several months.

Participants had to predict ETH price 5 min, 10 min, …, 60 min ahead. Reward $ goes to those with lowest prediction error.

Now, Predict-ETH Data Challenge is transforming into Challenge DF. 

Challenge DF is part of Ocean DF. 🚜🪼

Why:
- Lower overhead --> uses DF ops
- Preps the stage for more evolution yet 👀

Data Farming's updated structure:

- Active DF: 75K OCEAN weekly. Earn by locking OCEAN for veOCEAN.

- Passive DF with substreams:
   - Volume DF: 70K OCEAN weekly. Earn by pointing veOCEAN to high-DCV assets
   - Challenge DF [new]: 5K OCEAN weekly. Earn by predicting ETH

Challenge DF Details
- Predictions are due every Wed, right before midnight
- Predict for Thu at 12.05am, 12.10am, ..., 1.00am
- Rewards: 2500 OCEAN for lowest error, 1500 for 2nd-lowest, 1000 for 3rd
- Rewards are calc'd & distr'd as part of DF ops
- Claim rewards in DF app

Are you ready to predict ETH price? With Challenge DF, competitions are weekly with 5000 $OCEAN in prizes.

The first competition is live now.

Thank you for spending your valuable time to read my feedback on the Ambasador program. Please take all criticism and sense for common sense purposes to improve the Ocean Protocol ecosystem and optimize all processes. 


First of all, as an Ambassador I am very happy to be in such a community and thank you all for your input. But, now to get to the point of this post:

Huge thanks to @blockchainlugano for the work done. This effort to introduce something new has really succeeded and the Ambassador program has been transformed. But in all new innovations there are also disadvantages:

1) Lack of tracking the work of other ambassadors (In a good way) I every person who is sensible analyzes some things. So while writing some content, I had difficulties in analyzing the topics that others wrote on so that there was no overlap.


2) Binding your wallet to the platform.
As you have seen in the community, many do not have the desire to connect their wallet to an unknown source. This does not prevent us from creating another wallet and using an ""empty"" one, but security is paramount!!!!

3) Incorrect distribution of responsibilities. I don't have information on internal operational aspects within the team. But it seems to me that almost most of the work is done only by @blockchainlugano  in Ambassador Programm. Maybe I'm wrong and underestimate other people's labor (but I'm judging purely from my own view). 

4) I propose to reformat the ambassador program next week. All ambassadors will write treads on one given topic and whoever dives deeper and hits the most important aspects is the OPF winner.",,

With the upgrade of the ambasador program, there is a very large influx of users. This is good on both sides. But I'd like to only touch on the bad one: these people came here for money, which is not just handed out here. I do not want to strongly affect other people's personalities and suggest to reduce the number of ambassadors to a minimum (the most active) And make a decent pay (by the standards of the project). 


Perhaps I forgot to mention something in the moment of writing this post. But there is no growth without mistakes. And Ocean Protocol clearly has room to grow. All the best and all the best.",,

It is super constructive and what the program aims for, which is being a community where everyone has a voice and contributes to its betterment.

As per #1 I have created a solution to this in a new document (link in ambassador channel and pinned) allowing everyone to post their work so that anyone can see what another has submitted.  Let me know if you feel this works.

As per #2, part of us wanting to reward contribution that we worked hard on with rep3 is for your work to go with you. Everything created has value, and we think it only fair that via your wallet address (of your choice) you should have a 'resume', otherwise there is no good way to verify your contributions in a decentralized manner. If the wallet address receives mOcean as payment, with Polygon gas fees, there is nothing stopping you from transferring to another wallet for security.

As per #4 we cannot give out a topic, this is up to the Ambassadors, we sometimes give guidelines if a new aspect of OPF has launched, but we prefer to leave the imagination open. Many past threads came out of nowhere, stuff even we hadn't thought of. The winner (s) is simply chosen by OPF. It's not, the best of the bunch wins (what if its all subpar?), but rather, the quality of writing and topic most valued by OPF to retweet.

As per #5, not everyone joining in will become ambassadors nor want to, they may want to simply feel part of a community and participate in simpler bounties. The onboarding process changed since you came in, and trust me, it is not so easy.

Hope that makes sense. We can continue this convo in the ambassador channel for others to weigh in.",,

Someone on their new Discord told me that Fetch.ai fell victim to the same thing that apparently Ocean did: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/05/discord-admins-hacked-by-malicious-bookmarks/ . However, that peson was not part of the Fetch team, they have been copiously quiet so I can't be sure that it was the same thing (unless someone here knows).  Now that link say it took Ocean only 30 minutes to recover.  But according to Fetch ""On Saturday, 12th August 2023, our old Discord server was compromised. We are actively working to address this situation however progress is slower than we had hoped, owing to Discord support response times.""  https://fetch.ai/content-hub/article/new-discord-server .  Note, that article is dated August 16, so 4 days later, and still their Discord server is up and running by the scammers.  Now can someone at Ocean explain this line ""Fortunately for Ocean, Scavuzzo was able to reach the operator of the server that hosts the Discord channel, and have the channel’s settings reverted back to normal.""  How was that possible if everyone is booted as admins?  Who is this ""operator of the server"" that is referred that could be contacted to fix things?  Could Fetch have done the same thing?  Further, what does Ocean think about this ""progress is slower ... owing to Discord support response times"" excuse by Fetch.ai?",,

Interestingly, it seems like a similar attack approach was used. However, the reason behind our swift recovery can be attributed to a couple of factors. First off, our team is made up of fantastic members who are actively present on Discord, even during off hours (they're like Discord superheroes! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️). Secondly, while an admin account was indeed compromised, it wasn't the super admin account. So, as soon as we got wind of the breach, the affected admin promptly altered the password, invalidated all access tokens, and our trusty super admin was quick to take control of the situation. 🛡️
I don't have the exact details on which fetch's Discord account was compromised, but if they had to seek help from Discord support, it's quite likely that their super admin account took the hit. That kind of breach can really put the brakes on recovery efforts.",,

On a side note, once ive released these 10 datasets, i’d like to apply to the shipyard for a grant to build functionality ontop of the marketplace and keep developping new datasets.

Whether that is a gooey for easier UI, or payment processing that accepts any currency and converts it to ocean on the backend, to remove friction for the UX, or other APIs etc..

I’d like to understand what Ocean has thought about so far, to improve the use of the marketplace, so i can take that into consideration.

There’s no rush on this. But i am wondering what to attend or who to talk to to get to know Oceans PoV",,ocean (1)

Just wanted to share that there is currently a ~15% arbitrage for anyone who wants exposure to veOCEAN through psdnOCEAN.
Basiaclly, rather than buying OCEAN and locking it into psdnOCEAN 1:1, you can just buy psdnOCEAN directly and receive ~14% extra psdnOCEAN.

Wednesday is considered to be the most productive day of the week, I wish everyone good work and the realization of achievements!

Let's lighten it up with a great topic of conversation. With the tremendous development of artificial intelligence and data. 
Have you thought about such crucial themes today as 

> The significance of Cloud infrastructure
> 
> Cloud and Edge provide flexible data storage alternatives. Data can be accessed by authorized entities anywhere, anytime. It's like data has become its own entity, with endless possibilities.

>  Forms of data ( structured and unstructured) 
> 
> • Structured: Leading analytics tools have been designed and optimized for structured data that is stored in a consistent format in traditional or cloud-based storage, such as a SQL database.
> • Unstructured: This data takes many shapes and can be text, images, audio, video, or incredibly complex 3D models of buildings, consumer devices, engines, etc.

> Problems with unstructured data and  what cutting-edge solutions have Ocean 
> 
> Have you had any experience using :
> 
> • Challenge Data Farming (DF) to build models for crypto price predictions 
> 
> • C2D Private Docker Registry (to build AI/ML models by keeping data privacy intact and getting valuable insights) 
> 
> • Predictoor (make unstructured crypto data valuable and extract insights from it) 
> 

Making private/public data valuable - today`s mainstream in the development of data. 
How do you think Ocean's developments will change Data's worldview? Looking forward to your reply!",,"👍 (2),🔥 (3),ocean (1)"

Highlights stuff that I may emphasize: 

• Very Up-to-date info about extracting value from tagged, accessible data using machine learning and artificial intelligence services

• Migrate data to the cloud for secure and accessible storage, enabling value and insights.

 https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/24/the-new-era-of-big-data/?sh=5a36c9495783

Summary: Despite the success of data analytics in recent years, we have only scratched the surface. Most tools focus on structured data, while unstructured data remains largely untapped. Unstructured data makes up 80% of enterprise data but has been limited by hardware constraints. We need to leverage the variety and flexibility of data in its natural format instead of forcing it into predefined models.",,🔥 (2)

First for this, you'll need to have a data set cleaned and formatted for use to train. Next, you'll be able to publish the asset to https://market.oceanprotocol.com/ to allow access, data token, and storage of the model (IPFS, url, graphQL, etc) - the latter to these steps will be up to you using the LLM, model training or inference and so forth",,

👍🏾 Ok. Let’s say I have structured and cleaned tabular data in the following DataStructure. Let’s say 

user_name | comment | country_code | user_category | some_derived_tags

All are “string” data type. 

Imagine I have 50,000,000 records in total stored as one object in AWS S3. 
Do I treat the entire object (which is Bigdata to me) as one asset here?

How do I store them in their “encrypted” form using Ocean protocol? Choice of decentralized storage : IPFS at the moment, we may move to areweave in future. 

Pre-Trained  LLM models are on the internet. But I want to retrain on my custom data shown above and store the Model (encrypted form) for dAPP interactions. Please send me some docs to read and try hands-on.

@blockchainlugano @doteth @dotunwilfred.eth @bhavingala @Maki

My pseudonym is transhyprocrite.eth and I am interested starting a wiki to map out DAO's, such as Sushi Swap. I did some research and found this thing called The Heilmeier Catechism that the Department of Defence used to manage their projects. I think it would be cool if all DAO's answered the same questions and we can put it in some sort of wiki. I have linked a google doc below so we can get started....

Few Q's just if anyone is kind enough to answer any of them whilst I dive deeper over the next few days! 
- what programming lang is used here?
- what sector of ai would you say you fall under? computing power/storage/oracle/ai agent etc? Maybe none of it, instead can maybe facilitate an array of ai protocols?
- was this fair launched?
- is there a burn mechanismh here?
- token inflationary or deflationary?
- is it possible to stake?
- where can i find info on team background?

> Ocean Protocol supports multiple programming languages
> 
> JavaScript: Ocean.js is a JavaScript library used for interacting with the Ocean Protocol ecosystem.
> Python: Ocean.py is a Python library used for integrating applications with the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. 

> I think the above mentioned technologies have already captured most of the market. I think that in the next year will evolve - CRM AI systems will find sales opportunities, automate customer capture, predict demand, make product recommendations and guide the customer through the next steps to purchase.

> Ocean Protocol launched the Ocean Token in November 2017, alongside its Marketplace Framework which outlines the market attributes and components necessary to deploy the decentralized Ocean Protocol data exchange.
> 
> As i remember correctly at launch Ocean Protocol has Hard Cap —  hard caps by each phase — Seed, Pre-Launch and Network Launch

> Ocean token model:
> OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage volume 
> - A rise in usage volume → leads to more network revenue, which goes to Ocean community via (a) burning OCEAN (b) other community initiatives
> - A rise in usage volume → leads to more OCEAN being locked

> OCEAN is actually deflationary as 5% of all network revenue is burned. This means OCEAN supply will decrease faster with greater adoption of the Ocean Protocol.

I have researched interesting solutions in recent times that will fundamentally change that narrative. 

AI for anti-money laundering (AML):

> Elliptic integrates AI to detect suspicious blockchain transactions and money laundering activities, increasing trust in crypto platforms.

Fraud detection with big data and AI:

> Binance uses real-time machine learning to uncover fraudulent transactions, reducing costs and human effort.

Using AI and blockchains for data validation:

> IBM and Walmart's ""Food Trust"" project combines blockchain technology and AI-based analytics to track supply chain databases and improve processes.

Challenges persist:

> Bitcoin dominance poses a challenge for non-Bitcoin projects during bear markets. Funding concerns and regulatory uncertainty affect the success of crypto projects. Reluctance from institutional players due to low regulatory clarity. Concerns about unethical aspects of AI marginalizing human innovation.

Ocean Protocol was governed through the OceanDAO grants program (2021-2022), where OCEAN was used for community voting and governance. Currently, there are no governance functions associated with the token. The ""ve"" in veOCEAN stands for ""vote escrowed,"" and it is used for voting on assets in the Ocean ecosystem, providing community members with voting rights",,

The contracts proving the release & vesting are open-source and can always be monitored at: 


https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol
https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletLinear.sol

To have one less point of failure in the system. Ocean's vision has always been to slowly (but responsibly) move to a fully decentralised architecture, with ideally zero points of failure to make Ocean fully censorship resistant. 


However, this comes in little steps. And as the technology becomes more mature/robust, the more smart contract automation will be taking place. And more keys will be thrown away (hence also the multi-sig). 


This is what further enhance security and will eventually make Ocean fully community-owned, just like Bitcoin. No owners, but its community! 


Does this clarify?",,

The amount of active rewards you receive can vary due to several factors beyond just the APY of the dataset you allocated to. Here are some potential reasons for the discrepancy:

1. Changes in Data Consume Volume (DCV): If the DCV for the dataset you allocated to has decreased, this could result in lower rewards despite a higher APY.
2. Changes in veOCEAN allocations: If other participants have allocated more veOCEAN to the same dataset, the rewards could be distributed among more stakeholders, reducing your share.
3. Changes in the total OCEAN locked: If there has been an increase in the total OCEAN locked, it could affect the distribution of rewards.
4. Variations in the OCEAN reward schedule: The total amount of OCEAN distributed as rewards can change, as outlined in the reward schedule.
5. Timing of allocations: The timing of when you allocate your veOCEAN can influence the rewards due to the progressive counting of voting power throughout the week.",,

APYs are an estimate because they depend on both DF rewards and OCEAN locked.

OCEAN lock time greatly affects APY. The numbers assume that all locked OCEAN is locked for 4 years, so that 1 OCEAN → 1 veOCEAN.

For passive rewards, APY is highly dependent on the locked amount and duration of lock.

In other DF streams, there are other factors that affect APY.

APY could be much worse or better if you lock for shorter durations.

The numbers assume that you’re actively allocating veOCEAN allocation towards high-DCV data assets.",,

The OCEAN rewards you receive from delegating your veOCEAN to a predictoor asset in Volume Data Farming come from the Ocean Protocol's Data Farming incentives program. Specifically, in the context of Predictoor, 80% of prediction feed sales go to predictoors themselves, and a portion of the sales from prediction feeds is used to purchase prediction feeds, which includes the OCEAN allocated weekly to Predictoor Data Farming. This suggests that the rewards are not just from the total supply given by the foundation but are also generated from real yield coming from people who use the predictoor and purchase prediction feeds.

""Success is not the key to motivation. Motivation is the key to success. Keep pushing forward and never lose sight of your goals.""

""Remember that every small step counts. Even the tiniest progress is still progress. Keep going!""

""Challenges are just opportunities in disguise. Embrace them, learn from them, and use them to grow.""

""Teamwork makes the dream work. Together, we can achieve greatness and overcome any obstacle.""

""Rise above the negativity and believe in the power of positivity. A positive mindset can drive you towards success.""

""Failure is not the end, it's just a stepping stone towards success. Learn from your mistakes and keep pushing forward.""

""Believe in yourself and your abilities. You are capable of more than you can imagine. Trust in your potential.""

""Stay focused, stay determined, and never give up. Your hard work will pay off, and your dreams will become a reality.""

""Take pride in the work you do. Your effort and dedication make a difference, and your contributions matter.""

""Always strive for improvement. Be better than you were yesterday, and let your progress inspire others.""

""Be patient and persistent, make every step count. That way, you'll have converted those stepping stones into staircases to reach your milestone.""",,

(1) I understand by locking Ocean in veOcean, I could get rewards from data farming. But what exactly does veOcean if I not delegate my veOcean to datasets? What I mean is: by locking to veOcean is it simply giving the marketplace liquidity or?

And my second question is: (2). You read a lot of times about partnerships with Ocean or companys who make there own marketplace from Ocean's code. Does I as a investor in Ocean benefit from those marketplaces? Does there marketplaces use Ocean tokens to run? Or what is the benefit from company's who work with the by Ocean created marketplace 'layout'?",,

1. By locking OCEAN to get veOCEAN, you are not simply providing liquidity to the marketplace. veOCEAN serves several purposes:

Passive OCEAN Rewards: Holding veOCEAN entitles you to passive OCEAN rewards every week.

Active OCEAN Rewards: Allocating veOCEAN towards data assets can earn you active OCEAN rewards weekly, based on the sales of the assets you support in the Ocean ecosystem.

Delegating: You have the option to delegate your veOCEAN to other Data Farmers who can curate datasets for you, potentially earning you APY on active rewards.

Publisher Stake Bonus: If you are a publisher, allocating veOCEAN to your own asset gives your veOCEAN a 2x bonus, incentivizing publishers to engage with their assets and benefit the Ocean ecosystem.

Locking OCEAN for veOCEAN is a commitment that aligns with the long-term incentives of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. It is not just about providing liquidity but also about participating in the governance and curation within the Ocean Protocol's Data Economy.",,

When companies create their own marketplaces using Ocean's code, the Ocean ecosystem can benefit in several ways. While these third-party marketplaces may use a different currency for transactions, if they are publicly accessible, indexable, and abide by the fee structure set out by Ocean Protocol, transaction fees would be remitted back to the Ocean community. These fees contribute to the ecosystem's revenue, which can support the buy-and-burn process of the OCEAN token, potentially reducing the supply and creating value for OCEAN holders.

Additionally, the usage of Ocean's open-source tech stack, even if transactions are paid in a currency other than OCEAN, still generates a small fee for the Ocean community with each consumed transaction. This fee accrues whether OCEAN is used or not, and the details are provided in the documentation.

The APY is influenced by various factors, including the amount of OCEAN locked, the duration of the lock, and whether the rewards are passive or active. Specifically:

APYs are estimates because they rely on both DF rewards and locked OCEAN.

The lock time of OCEAN significantly impacts APY, assuming that all locked OCEAN is secured for 4 years, converting 1 OCEAN to 1 veOCEAN.

For passive rewards, APY depends heavily on the locked amount and the duration of the lock.

Different DF streams may have other factors affecting APY.

APY could vary significantly based on the duration of the lock, being either worse or better.

The figures assume active allocation of veOCEAN towards high-DCV data assets.",,

To stake OCEAN tokens, you can lock OCEAN and earn rewards via Ocean Data Farming. You can acquire veOCEAN by locking your OCEAN tokens in the Data Farming dApp, which allows you to vote on your favorite assets in the Ocean ecosystem. Passive Data Farming rewards are earned by locking OCEAN for veOCEAN for a period of time.

To lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, you can use the Data Farming dApp. The longer you lock OCEAN, the more veOCEAN you get, with a maximum lock period of four years for the highest rewards. After the lock period ends, you can withdraw your principal OCEAN tokens.",,❤️ (1)

Ocean Data Farming (DF) is an incentive program by Ocean Protocol that rewards participants with OCEAN tokens for engaging in activities that boost Data Consume Volume (DCV) within the ecosystem. Participants can earn rewards by locking OCEAN into veOCEAN, curating data, or making predictions. DF operates similarly to DeFi liquidity mining but is specifically tailored for DCV.

Ocean Predictoor is both a stack and a dapp designed for prediction feeds with accountability for accuracy through staking. It is globally distributed and resistant to censorship as it operates on-chain, and its accuracy is expected to improve over time due to its incentive structure. The initial use case for Ocean Predictoor is predicting DeFi token performance.",,

1) The websites are not at all intuitive; it really hinders the project. I visited the sites (I'm French) and I really didn't understand everything. It's something that needs to be conveyed to the frontend developers of the project to improve the user experience.

2) The documentation on Ocean Protocol is not clear enough (in my opinion). There is too much information all at once, and everything is a bit overwhelming. There needs to be more clarity in the instructional documents. By the way, I think a ""Links"" channel in the Discord server could be useful, where all the relevant links regarding Ocean Protocol can be shared.

3) It's not easy to grasp what Ocean Protocol does. The goals and the project need to be made clearer. Establishing a roadmap, for example, and focusing on one thing. Ocean is introducing a prediction system, which seems to deviate a bit from its original idea of providing DATA for AI companies and anyone in need of DATA, right?

4) The community and hype need to be rebuilt. Perhaps by organizing events, unlocking funds to attract new users, creating an engaged community. To help, you could lean on the crypto project: Monad. They have an excellent community and communication.

Is it possible to convey this information to the core team and work on it seriously? Otherwise, Ocean Protocol is a very promising project. I actually created a thread to present it, available here: https://x.com/Tom_crpt/status/1728828780288868747?s=20",,

How are you?)

When you delegate your veOCEAN tokens to a dataset in Volume Data Farming (Volume DF), you are not providing liquidity but rather allocating your veOCEAN to data assets with high data consume volume (DCV). This is a form of data curation, as your veOCEAN allocation helps to signal the value of the data asset within the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. The more veOCEAN allocated to an asset, the higher its rank in terms of DCV, which can influence the distribution of OCEAN rewards from the Volume DF.",,

Delegation also allows you to transfer your veOCEAN allocation power to another wallet, which can be useful if you want to manage your allocations from a different wallet or if you wish to allow someone else to manage the allocations on your behalf.

The suggested solution is through the development and widespread adoption of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The idea is to accelerate BCI technology, making it accessible to the general public (BCI/acc). The strategy involves creating compelling BCI applications, such as silent messaging, to generate demand and drive the evolution of BCI devices.

Predictions work with Ocean through the Ocean Predictoor, which is a stack and dapp for prediction feeds with accountability for accuracy via staking. Predictoors submit individual predictions and stake on them, earning money when they're correct and losing money when not. This incentivizes accurate prediction feeds. Predictoor is built on the Ocean Protocol stack and uses the Oasis Sapphire privacy-preserving EVM chain for keeping predictions private unless paid for.

1. The number of predictoor bots behind the USD-BTC 1H prediction is not disclosed to prevent potential exploitation and manipulation. The platform aims to show only trustable and secure metrics

2. You cannot directly invest in a specific predictoor bot. Instead, you can become a predictoor yourself by running your own prediction bot and staking OCEAN tokens on your predictions. If your predictions are accurate, you earn a portion of the sales revenue and potentially receive slashed stakes from incorrect predictions.",,

The differences in DCV between Week 73 and Week 74 could be due to a variety of factors, such as fluctuations in the number of data consume transactions, changes in the prices of data assets, or variations in the volume of data being consumed. It's also possible that specific events or activities occurred during Week 74 that temporarily increased the DCV, which then returned to lower levels. Since the DCV is influenced by the actual usage and sales of data assets, it can vary from week to week.",,

The APY is influenced by various factors, including the amount of OCEAN locked, the duration of the lock, and whether the rewards are passive or active. Specifically:

APYs are estimates because they rely on both DF rewards and locked OCEAN.

The lock time of OCEAN significantly impacts APY, assuming that all locked OCEAN is secured for 4 years, converting 1 OCEAN to 1 veOCEAN.

For passive rewards, APY depends heavily on the locked amount and the duration of the lock.

Different DF streams may have other factors affecting APY.

APY could vary significantly based on the duration of the lock, being either worse or better.

The figures assume active allocation of veOCEAN towards high-DCV data assets.",,"✅ (8),❤️ (1)"

 1. Choose a bridge platform:

Binance Bridge: This is the official bridge supported by Binance. It's a convenient choice if you already use Binance and it offers competitive fees. However, be aware of potential network congestion on both chains.
Anyswap: Another popular option offering fast bridging and various supported chains, including BNB Chain and Ethereum. Consider their fees and potential liquidity for larger amounts.
Portal Bridge: A new bridge focused on interoperability, offering quick transactions and competitive fees. Do your research on its track record and community feedback before proceeding.
 2. Connect your wallet:

 Connect your wallet containing the OCEAN tokens on BNB Chain to the chosen bridge platform. Most bridges support popular wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Binance Chain Wallet.

 3. Select tokens and amount:

 Choose OCEAN as the token you want to bridge and specify the amount you want to transfer. Remember to check the minimum transfer amount and any network fees involved.

 4. Initiate the bridge transaction:

 Review the transaction details and confirm the bridge process. Depending on the platform, you might need to approve additional steps within your wallet.

 5. Wait for completion:

 The bridging process can take some time depending on network congestion. The platform should provide you with an estimated completion time and transaction tracking information.

 6. Claim your tokens on Ethereum:

 Once the bridge completes, your OCEAN tokens will be available on your chosen Ethereum address. Connect your wallet to the bridge platform or any Ethereum wallet connected to the same address to access your bridged tokens.",,✅ (1)

For those unfamiliar, Predictoor is a stack and dapp for prediction feeds that ensures accuracy through staking. It's globally distributed, censorship-resistant, and built on the Ocean Protocol stack.

To get started with Predictoor, follow these steps:

Begin by exploring the dapp at predictoor.ai.

Click on ""run bots"" and review the Predictoor or Trader README. The ""How to Earn"" section of the blog provides detailed information.

For Predictoors, if your prediction is correct, you earn money, but if it's wrong, your staked amount is slashed and distributed among those who made the correct predictions. While it's technically possible to predict without using bots, doing so manually for hundreds or thousands of submissions would be tedious and error-prone. Therefore, using a bot is the most practical approach.

For Traders, the confidence in a prediction can be assessed by the amount of OCEAN staked on it. The accuracy of Predictoor predictions over time depends on various factors, including historical price information and potentially other data sources like social media or news.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612953349003673629/1209066743243481128/IMG_8663.jpg?ex=65e59226&is=65d31d26&hm=d0f0845920afdf52a84db77e3e3a7677541f13af6653488de9b091627545df42&,
